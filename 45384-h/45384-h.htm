      PUBLISHERS&rsquo; NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      For more than a generation Mr. Scudder&rsquo;s <i>Book of Fables and Folk
      Stories</i> has been a prime favorite with young readers. It has seemed to
      the publishers that a book which has maintained its popularity so long
      might well be furnished with illustrations more in accordance with the
      taste of the present day than those which were originally used. All the
      old pictures have therefore been replaced by drawings made by a modern
      artist, and it is hoped that readers of the volume will find its old charm
      heightened by this new feature.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nce upon a time
      there lived in a certain village a little girl. Her mother was very fond
      of her, and her grandmother loved her even more. This good old woman made
      for her a red cloak, which suited the child so well that ever after she
      was called Little Red-Riding-Hood. One day her mother made some cakes, and
      said to Little Red-Riding-Hood:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my dear, and see how grandmother does, for I hear that she has
      been very ill. Carry her a cake and a little pot of butter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Red-Riding-Hood set out at once to go to her grandmother, who lived
      in another village. As she was going through the wood she met a large
      Wolf. He had a very great mind to eat her up; but he dared not, for there
      were some wood-choppers near by. So he asked her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, little girl?&rdquo; The poor child did not
      know that it was dangerous to stop and talk with the Wolf, and she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a cake and a little
      pot of butter from my mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she live far off?&rdquo; asked the Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. It is beyond that mill, at the first house in the village.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;I will go and see her, too. I
      will go this way; do you go that, and we will see who will be there
      soonest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way,
      and Little Red-Riding-Hood went by the farthest. She stopped often to
      chase a butterfly, or pluck a flower, and so she was a good while on the
      way. The Wolf was soon at the old woman&rsquo;s house, and knocked at the
      door&mdash;tap, tap!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandchild, Little Red-Riding-Hood,&rdquo; replied the Wolf,
      changing his voice. &ldquo;I have brought you a cake and a pot of butter
      from mother.&rdquo; The good grandmother, who was ill in bed, called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull the string, and the latch will go up.&rdquo; The Wolf pulled
      the string, and the latch went up. The door opened, and he jumped in, and
      fell upon the old woman, and ate her up in less than no time, for he had
      not tasted food for three days. He then shut the door, and got into the
      grandmother&rsquo;s bed. By and by, Little Red-Riding-Hood came and
      knocked at the door&mdash;tap, tap!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Red-Riding-Hood heard the big voice of the Wolf, and at first she
      was afraid. Then she thought her grandmother must have a bad cold, so she
      answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Red-Riding-Hood. I have brought you a cake and a pot of
      butter from mother.&rdquo; The Wolf softened his voice as much as he
      could, and called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull the string, and the latch will go up.&rdquo; Little
      Red-Riding-Hood pulled the string, and the latch went up, and the door
      opened. The Wolf was hiding under the bedclothes and called out in a
      muffled voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put the cake and the pot of butter on the shelf, and come to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Red-Riding-Hood made ready for bed. Then she looked with wonder at
      her grandmother, who had changed so much, and she said:&mdash;&ldquo;Grandmother,
      what great arms you have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better to hug you, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother, what great ears you have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better to hear you, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother, what great eyes you have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better to see you, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother, what great teeth you have!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better to eat you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this the wicked Wolf sprang up and fell upon poor Little
      Red-Riding-Hood and ate her all up.

      THE GOOSE THAT LAID GOLDEN EGGS

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was a man who
      once had a Goose that always laid golden eggs, one every day in the year.

    <p>
      Now, he thought there must be gold inside of her. So he wrung her neck and
      laid her open.

      He found that she was exactly like all other geese. He thought to find
      riches, and lost the little he had.

    <h2>
      LITTLE ONE EYE, LITTLE TWO EYES, AND LITTLE THREE EYES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. THE GOAT
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was once a
      woman who had three daughters. The eldest was called Little One Eye,
      because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead. The second was
      called Little Two Eyes, because she had two eyes like other people. The
      youngest was called Little Three Eyes, because she had three eyes; the
      third eye was in the middle of her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Little Two Eyes looked like other people, her sisters and her
      mother could not bear her. They said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have two eyes and are no better than anybody else. You do not
      belong to us.&rdquo; They knocked her about, and gave her shabby clothes,
      and fed her with food left over from their meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Little Two Eyes was sent into the fields to look after the goat.
      She was hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat, and
      she sat down and began to cry. She cried so hard that a little stream of
      tears ran out of each eye. All at once a wise woman stood near her, and
      asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes, why do you cry?&rdquo; Little Two Eyes said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not need to cry? Because I have two eyes, like other people,
      my sisters and my mother cannot bear me. They knock me about and they give
      me shabby clothes. They feed me only with the food left over from their
      table. To-day they have given me so little that I am very hungry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise woman said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes, dry your eyes, and I will tell you what to do.
      Only say to your goat: &lsquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,&rsquo;
      and a table will stand before you, covered with food. Eat as much as you
      like. When you have had all you want, only say: &lsquo;Little goat, bleat;
      little table, away,&rsquo; and it will be gone.&rdquo; Then the wise woman
      disappeared. Little Two Eyes thought: &ldquo;I must try at once, for I am
      too hungry to wait.&rdquo; So she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,&rdquo; and there stood
      before her a little table covered with a white cloth. On it were laid a
      plate, knife and fork, and silver spoon. The nicest food was on the plate,
      smoking hot. Then Little Two Eyes began to eat, and found the food very
      good. When she had had enough, she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, away.&rdquo; In an instant the
      table was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a fine way to keep house,&rdquo; thought Little Two Eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day Little Two Eyes drove her goat home. She found a
      dish with some food in it. Her sisters had put it aside for her, but she
      did not taste it. She did not need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she went out again with her goat, and did not take the few
      crusts which her sisters put aside for her. This went on for several days.
      At last her sisters said to each other:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is not right with Little Two Eyes. She always leaves her food.
      She used to eat all that was given her. She must have found some other way
      to be fed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They meant to find out what Little Two Eyes did. So the next time that
      Little Two Eyes set out, Little One Eye came to her and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you into the field, and see that the goat is well
      taken care of, and feeds in the best pasture.&rdquo; But Little Two Eyes
      saw what Little One Eye had in her mind. So she drove the goat into the
      long grass, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Little One Eye, we will sit down and I will sing to you.&rdquo;
      Little One Eye sat down. She was tired after her long walk in the hot sun,
      and Little Two Eyes began to sing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake, Little One Eye? Are you asleep, Little One Eye? Are
      you awake, Little One Eye? Are you asleep, Little One Eye? Are you awake?
      Are you asleep? Awake? Asleep?&rdquo; By this time Little One Eye had shut
      her one eye and was fast asleep. When Little Two Eyes saw this, she said
      softly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, rise;&rdquo; and she sat at the
      table and ate and drank till she had had enough. Then she said as before:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, away,&rdquo; and in a twinkling
      all was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Two Eyes now awoke Little One Eye, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little One Eye, why do you not watch? You have been asleep, and the
      goat could have run all over the world. Come! let us go home.&rdquo; So
      home they went, and Little Two Eyes again did not touch the dish. The
      others asked Little One Eye what Little Two Eyes did in the field. But she
      could only say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I fell asleep out there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. THE TREE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next day, the mother said to Little Three Eyes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time <i>you</i> must go with Little Two Eyes, and see if any
      one brings her food and drink.&rdquo; Then Little Three Eyes said to
      Little Two Eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you into the field, and see that the goat is well
      taken care of, and feeds in the best pasture.&rdquo; But Little Two Eyes
      saw what Little Three Eyes had in her mind. So she drove the goat into the
      long grass, and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Come, Little Three Eyes, we will sit
      down, and I will sing to you.&rdquo; Little Three Eyes sat down. She was
      tired after her long walk in the hot sun, and Little Two Eyes began to
      sing, as before:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake, Little Three Eyes?&rdquo; but instead of going on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you asleep, Little Three Eyes?&rdquo; she did not think, and
      sang:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you asleep, Little Two Eyes?&rdquo; and went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake, Little Three Eyes? Are you asleep, Little Two Eyes?
      Are you awake? Are you asleep? Awake? Asleep?&rdquo; By this time the two
      eyes of Little Three Eyes fell asleep. But the third eye did not go to
      sleep, for it was not spoken to by the verse. Little Three Eyes, to be
      sure, shut it, and made believe that it went to sleep. Then she opened it
      a little way and watched Little Two Eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Little Two Eyes thought Little Three Eyes was fast asleep, she said
      softly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, rise;&rdquo; and she sat at the
      table and ate and drank till she had had enough. Then she said as before:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, away.&rdquo; But Little Three
      Eyes had seen everything. Little Two Eyes now woke Little Three Eyes, and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Three Eyes, why do you not watch? You have been asleep, and
      the goat could have run all over the world. Come! let us go home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So home they went, and Little Two Eyes again did not touch the dish. Then
      Little Three Eyes said to the mother:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why the proud thing does not eat. She says to the goat:
      &lsquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,&rsquo; and there stands a
      table before her. It is covered with the very best of things to eat, much
      better than anything we have. When she has had enough to eat, she says:
      &lsquo;Little goat, bleat; little table, away,&rsquo; and all is gone. I
      have seen it just as it is. She put two of my eyes to sleep, but the one
      in my forehead stayed awake.&rdquo; Then the mother cried out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall she be better off than we are?&rdquo; With that she took a
      knife and killed the goat. Poor Little Two Eyes went to the field, and sat
      down and began to cry. All at once the wise woman stood near her, and
      asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes, why do you cry?&rdquo; Little Two Eyes said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not need to cry? My mother has killed the goat. Now I must
      suffer hunger and thirst again.&rdquo; The wise woman said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes, dry your eyes, and I will tell you what to do. Beg
      your sisters to give you the heart of the goat. Then bury it in the ground
      before the door of the house. All will go well with you.&rdquo; Then the
      wise woman was gone, and Little Two Eyes went home and said to her
      sisters:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sisters, give me some part of my goat. I do not ask for anything
      but the heart.&rdquo; They laughed, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have that, if you do not want anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Two Eyes took the heart and buried it in the ground before the door
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the sisters woke and saw a splendid tree in front of the
      house. It had leaves of silver and fruit of gold. It was wonderful to
      behold; and they could not think how the tree had come there in the night.
      Only Little Two Eyes knew that the tree had grown out of the heart of the
      goat. Then the mother said to Little One Eye:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb up, my child, and pluck some fruit from the tree.&rdquo;
      Little One Eye climbed the tree. She put out her hand to take a golden
      apple, but the branch sprang back. This took place every time. Try as hard
      as she could, she could not get a single apple. Then the mother said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Three Eyes, you climb up. You can see better with your three
      eyes than Little One Eye can.&rdquo; Down came Little One Eye, and Little
      Three Eyes climbed the tree. She put out her hand, and the branch sprang
      back as it had from Little One Eye. At last the mother tried, but it was
      the same with her. She could not get a single apple. Then Little Two Eyes
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; they all cried. &ldquo;You, with your two eyes like
      other people! What can you do?&rdquo; But Little Two Eyes climbed the
      tree, and the branch did not spring back. The golden apples dropped into
      her hands, and she brought down her apron full of them. Her mother took
      them away from her, and her two sisters were angry because they had
      failed, and they were more cruel than ever to Little Two Eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. THE PRINCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      While they stood by the tree, the Prince came riding near on a fine horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, Little Two Eyes,&rdquo; said her sisters, &ldquo;creep under
      this cask; we are ashamed of you.&rdquo; And they threw an empty cask over
      her, and pushed the golden apples under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince rode up and gazed at the splendid tree. &ldquo;Is this splendid
      tree yours?&rdquo; he asked of the sisters. &ldquo;If you will give me a
      branch from it, I will give you anything you wish.&rdquo; Then Little One
      Eye and Little Three Eyes said the tree was theirs, and they would break
      off a branch for him. They put out their hands, but again the branches
      sprang back. Then the Prince said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very strange. The tree is yours, and yet you cannot pluck
      the fruit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept on saying that the tree was theirs, but while they were saying
      this, Little Two Eyes rolled a few of the apples out from under the cask.
      The Prince saw them, and asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! where did these golden apples come from? Who is under the
      cask?&rdquo; Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes told the Prince that
      they had a sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does not show herself,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;She is just
      like other people. She has two eyes.&rdquo; Then the Prince called:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes! come out!&rdquo; So Little Two Eyes was very glad
      and crept out from under the cask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get me a branch from the tree?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Little Two Eyes, &ldquo;I can, for the tree is
      mine.&rdquo; Then she climbed the tree and broke off a branch. It had
      silver leaves and golden fruit, and she gave it to the Prince. Then the
      Prince said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Two Eyes, what shall I give you for it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Little Two Eyes, &ldquo;I suffer hunger and thirst
      all day long. If you would take me with you, I should be happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Prince lifted Little Two Eyes upon his horse, and they rode away.
      He took her to his father&rsquo;s house and made her Princess, and she had
      plenty to eat and drink and good clothes to wear. Best of all, the Prince
      loved her, and she had no more hard knocks and cross words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when Little Two Eyes rode away with the Prince, the sisters said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall have the tree. We may not pluck the fruit, but every
      one will stop to see it and come to us and praise it.&rdquo; But the next
      morning when they went to look at the tree, it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Two Eyes lived long and happily. One day, two poor women came to
      her, and asked for something to eat. Little Two Eyes looked at their faces
      and knew them. They were Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes. They were
      so poor that they were begging bread from door to door. Little Two Eyes
      brought them into the house and was very good to them. Then they both were
      sorry for the evil they had once done their sister.

    </p>
    <p>
      The Wind began to blow great guns, but the man only drew his cloak closer
      about him to keep out the cold. At last the gust was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Sun took his turn. He shone and it was warm and bright. The man

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do? My brothers can take care of themselves with a
      mill and an ass. But I can only eat the cat and sell his skin. Then what
      will be left? I shall die of hunger.&rdquo; The cat heard these words and
      looked up at his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be troubled,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me a bag and get me
      a pair of boots, and I will soon show you what I can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not see what the cat could do, but he knew he could do
      many strange things. He had seen him hang stiff by his hind legs as if he
      were dead. He had seen him hide himself in the meal tub. Oh, the cat was a
      wise one! Besides, what else was there for the young man to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      So he got a bag and a pair of boots for the cat. Puss drew on the boots
      and hung the bag about his neck. Then he took hold of the two strings of
      the bag with his fore paws and set off for a place where there were some
      rabbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He filled his bag with bran and left the mouth of the bag open. Then he
      lay down, shut his eyes, and seemed to be sound asleep. Soon a young
      rabbit smelled the bran and saw the open bag. He went headlong into it,
      and at once the cat drew the strings and caught the rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puss now went to the palace, and asked to speak to the king. So he was
      brought before the king. He made a low bow and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, this is a rabbit which my master bade me bring to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is your master?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; said the cat. This was a title
      which Puss took it into his head to give to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your master that I accept his gift,&rdquo; said the king, and
      Puss went off in his boots. In a few days he hid himself with his bag in a
      cornfield. This time he caught two partridges, and carried them to the
      king. The king sent his thanks to the Marquis of Carabas, and made a
      present to Puss.
    </p>
    <p>
      So things went on for some time. Every week Puss brought some game to the
      king, and the king began to think the Marquis of Carabas a famous hunter.
      Now it chanced that the king and his daughter were about to take a drive
      along the banks of a river. Puss heard of it and went to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do just as I tell you, and your
      fortune will be made. You need only go and bathe in the river, and leave
      the rest to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said his master. He did as the cat told him, but
      he did not know what it all meant. While he was in the river, the king and
      the princess drove by. Puss jumped out of the bushes and began to bawl:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help! the Marquis of Carabas is drowning! save him!&rdquo;
      The king heard and looked out of his carriage. There he saw the cat that
      had brought him so much game, and he bade his men run to help the Marquis.
      When he was out of the river, Puss came forward, and told what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;My master was bathing, and some robbers came and stole his clothes.
      I ran after them and cried, &lsquo;Stop, thief!&rsquo; but they got away.
      Then my master was carried beyond his depth, and would have drowned, if
      you had not come by with your men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the king bade one of his servants ride back and bring a fine suit
      of clothes for the Marquis, and they all waited. So, at last, the Marquis
      of Carabas came up to the carriage, dressed much more finely than he ever
      had been in his life. He was a handsome fellow, and he looked so well that
      the king at once bade him enter the carriage.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. PUSS AND THE LION
    </h3>
    <p>
      Puss now had things quite to his mind. He ran on before, and came to a
      meadow, where some men were mowing grass. He stopped before them, and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king is coming this way. You must tell him that this field
      belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, or you shall all be chopped as fine as
      mince-meat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the carriage came by, the king put his head out, and said to
      the men:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is good grass land. Who owns it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; they all said, for Puss had thrown
      them into a great fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a fine estate, Marquis,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sire,&rdquo; he replied, tossing his head; &ldquo;it pays me
      well.&rdquo; Puss still ran before the carriage, and came soon to some
      reapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the king,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that all this grain belongs
      to the Marquis of Carabas, or you shall all be chopped as fine as
      mince-meat.&rdquo; The king now came by, and asked the reapers who owned
      the grain they were cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0039.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis of Carabas,&rdquo; they said. So it Went on. Puss bade
      the men in the fields call the Marquis of Carabas their lord, or it would
      go hard with them. The king was amazed. The Marquis took it all with a
      grand air. It was easy to see that he was a very rich and great man. The
      princess sat in the corner of the carriage, and thought the Marquis no
      mean fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they drew near the castle of the one who really owned all the
      fields they had passed through. Puss asked about him, and found he was a
      monster who made every one about him very much afraid. Puss sent in word
      that he should like to pay his respects, and the monster bade him come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told,&rdquo; said Puss, &ldquo;that you can change
      yourself into any kind of animal. They say you can even make yourself a
      lion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I can,&rdquo; said the monster. &ldquo;Do you not
      believe it? Look, and you shall see me become a lion at once.&rdquo; When
      Puss saw a lion before him he was in a great fright, and got as far away
      as he could. There he stayed till the lion became a monster again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was dreadful!&rdquo; said Puss. &ldquo;I was nearly dead with
      fear. But it must be much harder to make yourself small. They do say that
      you can turn into a mouse, but I do not believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not believe it!&rdquo; cried the monster. &ldquo;You shall see!&rdquo;
      So he made himself at once into a mouse, and began running over the floor.
      In a twinkling Puss pounced upon him and gave him one shake. That was the
      end of the monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the king had reached the gates of the castle, and thought he
      would like to see so fine a place. Puss heard the wheels, and ran down
      just as the king drove up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; he said, as he stood on the steps of the castle.
      &ldquo;Welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! my lord Marquis,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;does this
      castle, too, belong to you? I never saw anything so fine. I should really
      like to enter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is welcome!&rdquo; said the young man, bowing low,
      taking off the cap which the king had given him. Then he gave his hand to
      the princess, and they went up the steps. Puss danced before them in his
      boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came into a great hall, and there they found a feast spread. The
      monster had asked some friends to dine with him that day, but the news
      went about that the king was at the castle, and so they dared not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was amazed at all he saw, and the princess went behind him, just
      as much pleased. The Marquis of Carabas said little. He held his head high
      and played with his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over, the king took the Marquis one side, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only to say the word, my lord Marquis, and you shall be
      the son-in-law of your king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Marquis married the princess, and Puss in Boots became a great
      lord, and hunted mice for mere sport, just when he pleased.

    <h2>
      THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was once a
      Shoemaker who worked very hard and was honest. Still, he could not earn
      enough to live on. At last, all he had in the world was gone except just
      leather enough to make one pair of shoes. He cut these out at night, and
      meant to rise early the next morning to make them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was light in spite of his troubles, for his conscience was
      clear. So he went quietly to bed, left all his cares to God, and fell
      asleep. In the morning he said his prayers and sat down to work, when, to
      his great wonder, there stood the shoes, already made, upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man knew not what to say or think. He looked at the work. There
      was not one false stitch in the whole job. All was neat and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same day a customer came in, and the shoes pleased him so well that
      he readily paid a price higher than usual for them. The Shoemaker took the
      money and bought leather enough to make two pairs more. He cut out the
      work in the evening and went to bed early. He wished to be up with the sun
      and get to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was saved all trouble, for when he got up in the morning, the work was
      done. Pretty soon buyers came in, who paid him well for his goods. So he
      bought leather enough for four pairs more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut out the work again over night, and found it finished in the morning
      as before. So it went on for some time. What was got ready at night was
      always done by daybreak, and the good man soon was well to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, at Christmas time, he and his wife sat over the fire,
      chatting, and he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to sit up and watch to-night, that we may see who it
      is that comes and does my work for me.&rdquo; So they left the light
      burning, and hid themselves behind a curtain to see what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it was midnight, there came two little Elves. They sat upon the
      Shoemaker&rsquo;s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began
      to ply their little fingers. They stitched and rapped and tapped at such a
      rate that the Shoemaker was amazed, and could not take his eyes off them
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went till the job was done, and the shoes stood, ready for use,
      upon the table. This was long before daybreak. Then they ran away as quick
      as lightning. The next day the wife said to the Shoemaker:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These little Elves have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful
      to them and do them some good in return. I am vexed to see them run about
      as they do. They have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what we must do; I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and
      waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain. Do you make each of
      them a little pair of shoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Shoemaker liked the thought very well. One evening, he and his
      wife had the clothes ready, and laid them on the table instead of the work
      they used to cut out. Then they went and hid behind the curtain to watch
      what the little Elves would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the Elves came in and were going to sit down at their work as
      usual. But when they saw the clothes lying there for them, they laughed
      and were in high glee.

      and sprang about as merry as could be, till at last they danced out of the
      door, and over the green.

      as he lived.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> thirsty Stag came
      to a spring to drink. As he drank, he looked into the water and saw
      himself. He was very proud of his horns, when he saw how big they were and
      what branches they had. But he looked at his feet, and took it hard that
      they should be so thin and weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, while he was thinking about these things, a Lion sprang out and began
      to chase him. The Stag turned and ran. As he was very fleet, he outran the
      Lion so long as they were on the open plain. But when they came to a piece
      of woods, the Stag&rsquo;s horns became caught in the branches of the
      trees. He could not run, and the Lion caught up with him.

      JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. THE BEANS ARE PLANTED
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the days of King
      Alfred a poor woman lived in a country village in England. She had an only
      son, Jack, who was a good-natured, idle boy. She was too easy with him.
      She never set him at work, and soon there was nothing left them but their
      cow. Then the mother began to weep and to think that she had brought up
      her boy very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel boy!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have at last made me a
      beggar. I have not money enough to buy a bit of bread. We cannot starve.
      We must sell the cow, and then what shall we do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Jack felt very badly and wished he had done better. But soon he
      began to think what fun it would be to sell the cow. He begged his mother
      to let him go with the cow to the nearest village. She was not very
      willing. She did not believe Jack knew enough to sell a cow, but at last
      she gave him leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off went Jack with the cow. He had not gone far when he met a Butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going with your cow?&rdquo; asked the Butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to sell it,&rdquo; said Jack. The Butcher held his hat
      in his hand and shook it. Jack looked into the hat and saw some
      odd-looking beans. The Butcher saw him eye them. He knew how silly Jack
      was, so he said to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you wish to sell your cow, sell her to me. I will give you
      all these beans for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack thought this a fine bargain. He gave the Butcher the cow and took the
      beans. He ran all the way home and could hardly wait to reach the house.
      He called out to his mother to see what he had got for the cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor woman saw only a few beans, she burst into tears. She was so
      vexed that she threw the beans out of the window. She did not even cook
      them for supper. They had nothing else to eat, and they went to bed
      hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack awoke early the next morning and thought it very dark. He went to the
      window and could hardly see out of it, for it was covered with something
      green. He ran downstairs and into the garden. There he saw a strange
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beans had taken root and shot up toward the clouds. The stalks were as
      thick as trees, and were wound about each other. It was like a green
      ladder, and Jack at once wished to climb to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran in to tell his mother, but she begged him not to climb the
      bean-stalk. She did not know what would happen. She was afraid to have him
      go. Who ever saw such bean-stalks before?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack had set his heart on climbing, and he told his mother not to be
      afraid. He would soon see what it all meant. So up he climbed. He climbed
      for hours. He went higher and higher, and at last, quite tired out, he
      reached the top.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. JACK CAPTURES A HEN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hen he looked
      about him. It was all new. He had never seen such a place before. There
      was not a tree or plant; there was no house or shed. Some stones lay here
      and there, and there were little piles of earth. He could not see a living
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack sat down on one of the stones. He wished he were at home again. He
      thought of his mother. He was hungry, and he did not know where to get
      anything to eat. He walked and walked, and hoped he might see a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw no house, but at last he saw a lady walking alone. He ran toward
      her, and when he came near, he pulled off his cap and made a bow. She was
      a beautiful lady, and she carried in her hand a stick. A peacock of fine
      gold sat on top of the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady smiled and asked Jack how he came there. He told her all about
      the bean-stalk. Then she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember your father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I do not know what became of him. When
      I speak of him to my mother, she cries, but she tells me nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dare not,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;but I will tell you. I
      am a fairy. I was set to take care of your father, but one day I was
      careless. So I lost my power for a few years, and just when your father
      needed me most I could not help him, and he died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack saw that she was very sorry as she told this story, but he begged her
      to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you may now help your mother.
      But you must do just as I tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was a good, kind man. He had a good wife, he had money,
      and he had friends. But he had one false friend. This was a Giant. Your
      father had once helped this Giant, but the Giant was cruel. He killed your
      father and took all his money. And he told your mother she must never tell
      you about your father. If she did, then the Giant would kill her and kill
      you too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were a little child then, and your mother carried you away in
      her arms. I could not help her at the time, but my power came back to me
      yesterday. So I made you go off with the cow, and I made you take the
      beans, and I made you climb the bean-stalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the land where the Giant lives. You must find him and rid
      the world of him. All that he has is yours, for he took it from your
      father. Now go. You must keep on this road till you see a great house. The
      Giant lives there. I cannot tell you what you must do next, but I will
      help you when the time comes. But you must not tell your mother anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fairy disappeared and Jack set out. He walked all day, and when the
      sun set, he came to the Giant&rsquo;s house. He went up to it and saw a
      plain woman by the door. This was the Giant&rsquo;s wife. Jack spoke to
      her and asked her if she would give him something to eat and a place where
      he could sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you not know? My husband is a
      Giant. He is away now, but he will be back soon. Sometimes he walks fifty
      miles in a day to see if he can find a man or a boy. He eats people. He
      will eat you if he finds you here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack was in great fear, but he would not give up. He asked the Giant&rsquo;s
      wife to hide him somewhere in the house. She was a kind woman, so she led
      him in. They went through a great hall, and then through some large rooms.
      They came to a dark passage, and went through it. There was a little
      light, and Jack could see bars of iron at the side. Behind the bars were
      wretched people. They were the prisoners of the Giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jack thought of his mother and wished himself at home again. He began
      to think the Giant&rsquo;s wife was as bad as the Giant, and had brought
      him in to shut him up here. Then he thought of his father and marched
      boldly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to a room where a table was set. Jack sat down and began to eat.
      He was very hungry and soon forgot his fears. But while he was eating,
      there came a loud knock at the outside door. It was so loud that the whole
      house shook. The Giant&rsquo;s wife turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is the Giant. He will
      kill you and kill me too! What shall I do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide me in the oven,&rdquo; said Jack. There was no fire under it,
      and Jack lay in the oven and looked out. The Giant came in and scolded his
      wife, and then he sat down and ate and drank for a long time. Jack thought
      he never would finish. At last the Giant leaned back in his chair and
      called out in a loud voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me my hen!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife brought a beautiful hen and placed it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay!&rdquo; roared the Giant, and the hen laid an egg of solid
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay another!&rdquo; And the hen laid another. So it went on. Each
      time the hen laid a larger egg than before. The Giant played with the hen
      for some time. Then he sent his wife to bed, but he sat in his chair. Soon
      he fell asleep, and then Jack crept out of the oven and seized the hen. He
      ran out of the house and down the road. He kept on till he came to the
      bean-stalk, and climbed down to his old home.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. THE GIANT&rsquo;S MONEY-BAGS
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ack&rsquo;s mother
      was very glad to see him. She was afraid that he had come to some ill end.
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it, mother,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo;
      and he showed her the hen. &ldquo;Lay!&rdquo; he said to the hen, and the
      hen laid an egg of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack and his mother now had all they needed, for they had only to tell the
      hen to lay, and she laid her golden egg. They sold the egg and had money
      enough. But Jack kept thinking of his father, and he longed to make
      another trial. He had told his mother about the Giant and his wife, but he
      had said nothing about the fairy and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother begged Jack not to climb the beanstalk again. She said the
      Giant&rsquo;s wife would be sure to know him, and he never would come back
      alive. Jack said nothing, but he put on some other clothes and stained his
      face and hands another color. Then, one morning, he rose early and climbed
      the bean-stalk a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to the Giant&rsquo;s house. The Giant&rsquo;s wife was
      again at the door, but she did not know him. He begged for food and a
      place to sleep. She told him about the Giant, and then she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was once a boy who came just as you have come. I let him in,
      and he stole the Giant&rsquo;s hen and ran away. Ever since the Giant has
      been very cruel to me. No, I cannot let you come in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jack begged so hard that at last she let him in. She led him through
      the house, and he saw just what he had seen before. She gave him something
      to eat, and then she hid him in a closet. The Giant came along in his
      heavy boots. He was so big, that the house shook. He sat by the fire for a
      time. Then he looked about and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife, I smell fresh meat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The crows have been flying about. They
      left some raw meat on top of the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she made haste and got some supper for the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very cross. So it went on as before. The Giant ate and drank. Then
      he called to his wife:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me something. I want to be amused. You let that rascal steal
      my hen. Bring me something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I bring?&rdquo; she asked meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me my money-bags; they are as heavy as anything.&rdquo; So
      she tugged two great bags to the table. One was full of silver and one was
      full of gold. The Giant sent his wife to bed. Then he untied the strings,
      emptied his bags, and counted his money. Jack watched him, and said to
      himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my father&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the Giant was tired. He put the money back into the bags and
      tied the strings. Then he went to sleep. He had a dog to watch his money,
      but Jack did not see the dog. So when the Giant was sound asleep, Jack
      came out of the closet and laid hold of the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the dog barked, and Jack thought his end had come. But the Giant
      did not wake, and Jack just then saw a bit of meat. He gave it to the dog,
      and while the dog was eating it, Jack took the two bags and was off.

      IV. THE HARP
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was two whole
      days before he could reach the bean-stalk, for the bags were very heavy.
      Then he climbed down with them. But when he came to his house the door was
      locked. No one was inside, and he knew not what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he found an old woman who showed him where his mother was.
      She was very sick in another house. The poor thing had been made ill by
      Jack&rsquo;s going away. Now that he had come back, she began to get well,
      and soon she was in her own house again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack said no more about the Giant and the bean-stalk. For three years he
      lived with his mother. They had money enough, and all seemed well. But
      Jack could not forget his father. He sat all day before the bean-stalk.
      His mother tried hard to amuse him, and she tried to find out what he was
      thinking about. He did not tell her, for he knew all would then go wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he could bear it no longer. He had changed in looks now, and he
      changed himself still more. Then, one bright summer morning, very early in
      the day, he climbed the bean-stalk once more. The Giant&rsquo;s wife did
      not know him when he came to the door of the house. He had hard work to
      make her let him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was hidden in the copper boiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Giant again came home, and was in a great rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I smell fresh meat!&rdquo; he cried. His wife could do nothing with
      him, and he began to go about the room. He looked into the oven, and into
      the closet, and then he came to the great boiler. Jack felt his heart
      stop. He thought now his end had come, surely. But the Giant did not lift
      the lid. He sat down by the fire and had his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over, the Giant told his wife to bring his harp. Jack
      peeped out of the copper and saw a most beautiful harp. The Giant placed
      it on the table, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack never heard such music as the harp played. No hands touched it. It
      played all by itself. He thought he would rather have this harp than the
      hen or all the money. By and by the harp played the Giant to sleep. Then
      Jack crept out and seized the harp. He was running off with it, when some
      one called loudly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master! Master!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the harp, but Jack would not let it go. The Giant started up, and
      saw Jack with the harp running down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, you rascal!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You stole my hen and my
      money-bags. Do you steal my harp? I&rsquo;ll catch you, and I&rsquo;ll
      break every bone in your body!&rdquo;
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch me if you can!&rdquo; said Jack. He knew he could run faster
      than the Giant. Off they went, Jack and the harp, and the Giant after
      them. Jack came to the bean-stalk. The harp was all the while playing
      music, but now Jack said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and the harp stopped playing. He hurried down the
      bean-stalk with the harp. There sat his mother, by the cottage, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cry, mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quick, bring me a
      hatchet! Make haste!&rdquo; He knew there was not a minute to spare. The
      Giant was already coming down. He was half-way down when Jack took his
      hatchet and cut the beanstalk down, close to its roots. Over fell the
      bean-stalk, and down came the Giant upon the ground. He was killed on the
      spot.

      In a moment the fairy was seen. She told Jack&rsquo;s mother everything,
      and how brave he had been. And that was the end. The beanstalk never grew
      again.

      THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> Miller and his
      Son were driving their Ass to the fair to sell him. They had not gone far,
      when they met a troop of girls, returning from the town, talking and
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; cried one of them. &ldquo;Did you ever see such
      fools, to be trudging along on foot, when they might be riding?&rdquo; The
      Miller, when he heard this, bade his Son get up on the Ass, and walked
      along merrily by his side. Soon they came to a group of old men talking
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said one of them; &ldquo;that proves what I was
      saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that
      idle young rogue riding, while his father has to walk? Get down, lazy boy,
      and let the old man get on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Son got down from the Ass, and the Miller took his place. They had not
      gone far when they met a company of women and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you lazy old fellow!&rdquo; cried several at once. &ldquo;How
      can you ride upon the beast, when that poor little lad can hardly keep up
      with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the good-natured Miller took his Son up behind him. They had now almost
      reached the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, my friend,&rdquo; said a townsman, &ldquo;is that Ass your
      own?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have thought so,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;by the
      way you load him. Why, you two are better able to carry the poor beast
      than he to carry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything to please you,&rdquo; said the Miller. So he and his Son
      got down from the Ass. They tied his legs together, and, taking a stout
      pole, tried to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge that led to the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so odd a sight that crowds of people ran out to see it, and to
      laugh at it. The Ass, not liking to be tied, kicked the cords away, and
      tumbled off the pole into the water. At this the Miller and his Son hung
      down their heads. They made their way home again, having learned that by
      trying to please everybody, they had pleased nobody, and lost the Ass into
      the bargain.

    <h2>
      CINDERELLA, OR THE GLASS SLIPPER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. CINDERELLA IN THE KITCHEN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nce upon a time
      there lived a man and his wife and one beautiful daughter. The wife fell
      sick and died, and some time after the father married again, for he needed
      some one to take care of his child. The new wife appeared very well before
      the wedding, but afterward she showed a bad temper. She had two children
      of her own, and they were proud and unkind like their mother. They could
      not bear their gentle sister, and they made her do all the hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      She washed the dishes, and scrubbed the stairs. She swept the floor in my
      lady&rsquo;s chamber, and took care of the rooms of the two pert misses.
      They slept on soft beds in fine rooms, and had tall looking-glasses, so
      that they could admire themselves from top to toe. She lay on an old straw
      sack in the garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bore all this without complaint. She did her work, and then sat in the
      corner among the ashes and cinders. So her two sisters gave her the name
      of Cinderella or the cinder-maid. But Cinderella was really much more
      beautiful than they; and she surely was more sweet and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the king&rsquo;s son gave a ball, and he invited all the rich and the
      grand. Cinderella&rsquo;s two sisters were fine ladies; they were to go to
      the ball. Perhaps they would even dance with the prince. So they had new
      gowns made, and they looked over all their finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was fresh work for poor Cinderella. She must starch their ruffles and
      iron their linen. All day long they talked of nothing but their fine
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wear my red velvet dress,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;and
      trim it with my point lace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the younger sister, &ldquo;shall wear a silk
      gown, but I shall wear over it a gold brocade, and I shall put on my
      diamonds. You have nothing so fine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they began to quarrel over their clothes, and Cinderella tried to
      make peace between them. She helped them about their dresses, and offered
      to arrange their hair on the night of the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus busy, the sisters said to her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Cinderella, would you like to go to the ball?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the poor girl; &ldquo;you are mocking me. It is
      not for such as I to go to balls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Folks would laugh to see a
      cinder-maid at a court ball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one else would have dressed their hair ill to spite them for their
      rudeness. But Cinderella was good-natured, and only took more pains to
      make them look well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters scarcely ate a morsel for two days before the ball. They
      wished to look thin and graceful. They lost their tempers over and over,
      and they spent most of the time before their tall glasses. There they
      turned and turned to see how they looked behind, and how their long trains
      hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the evening came, and off they set in a coach. Cinderella watched
      them till they were out of sight, and then she sat down by the kitchen
      fire and began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once her fairy godmother appeared, with her wand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying for, my little maid?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish&mdash;I wish,&rdquo; began the poor girl, but her voice was
      choked with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish that you could go to the ball?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if you will be a good girl, you shall go. Run quick and
      fetch me a pumpkin from the garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella flew to the garden and brought back the finest pumpkin she
      could find. She could not guess what use it would be, but the fairy
      scooped it hollow, and then touched it with her wand. The pumpkin became
      at once a splendid gilt coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now fetch me the mouse-trap from the pantry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mouse-trap were six sleek mice. The fairy opened the door, and as
      they ran out she touched each with her wand, and it became a gray horse.
      But what was she to do for a coachman?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might look for a rat in the rat-trap,&rdquo; said Cinderella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good thought. Run and bring the rat-trap, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Back came Cinderella with the trap. In it were three large rats. The fairy
      chose one that had long black whiskers, and she made him the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go into the garden and bring me six lizards. You will find them
      behind the water-pot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These were no sooner brought than, lo! with a touch of the wand they were
      turned into six footmen, who jumped up behind the coach, as if they had
      done nothing else all their days. Then the fairy said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is your coach and six, Cinderella; your coachman and your
      footmen. Now you can go to the ball.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! in these clothes?&rdquo; and Cinderella looked down at her
      ragged frock. The fairy laughed, and just touched her with the wand. In a
      twinkling, her shabby clothes were changed to a dress of gold and silver
      lace, and on her bare feet were silk stockings and a pair of glass
      slippers, the prettiest ever seen.

      moment after midnight, your coach will instantly become a pumpkin, your
      horses will be mice, your coachman a rat, and your footmen lizards. And
      you? You will be once more only a cinder-maid in a ragged frock and with
      bare feet.&rdquo;

      II. CINDERELLA IN THE PALACE
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>inderella promised
      and drove away in high glee. She dashed up to the palace, and her coach
      was so fine that the king&rsquo;s son came down the steps of the palace to
      hand out this unknown princess. He led her to the hall where all the
      guests were dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment she appeared all voices were hushed, the music stopped, and the
      dancers stood still. Such a beautiful princess had never been seen! Even
      the king, old as he was, turned to the queen and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most beautiful being I ever saw&mdash;since I first saw
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the ladies of the court, they were all busy looking at Cinderella&rsquo;s
      clothes. They meant to get some just like them the very next day, if
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince led Cinderella to the place of highest rank, and asked her hand
      for the next dance. She danced with so much grace that he admired her more
      and more. Supper was brought in, but the prince could not keep his eyes
      off the beautiful stranger. Cinderella went and sat by her sisters, and
      shared with them the fruit which the prince gave her. They were very proud
      to have her by them, for they never dreamed who she really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella was talking with them, when she heard the clock strike the
      quarter hour before twelve. She went at once to the king and queen, and
      made them a low courtesy and bade them good-night. The queen said there
      was to be another ball the next night, and she must come to that. The
      prince led her down the steps to her coach, and she drove home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house the fairy sat waiting for Cinderella. The maiden began to
      tell all that had happened, and was in the midst of her story, when a
      knock was heard at the door. It was the sisters coming home from the ball.
      The fairy disappeared, and Cinderella went to the door, rubbing her eyes,
      as if she had just waked from a nap. She was once more a poor little
      cinder-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How late you are!&rdquo; she said, as she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had been to the ball, you would not have thought it late,&rdquo;
      said her sisters. &ldquo;There came the most beautiful princess that ever
      was seen. She was very polite to us, and loaded us with oranges and
      grapes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; asked Cinderella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knew her name. The prince would give his eyes to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how I should like to see her,&rdquo; said Cinderella. &ldquo;Oh,
      do, my Lady Javotte,&rdquo;&mdash;that was the name of the elder sister,&mdash;&ldquo;lend
      me the yellow dress you wear every day, and let me go to the ball and have
      a peep at the beautiful princess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! lend my yellow gown to a cinder-maid! I am not so silly as
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella was not sorry to have Javotte say no; she would have been
      puzzled to know what to do if her sister had really lent her the dress she
      begged for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night came, and the sisters again went to the court ball. After
      they had gone, the fairy came as before and made Cinderella ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now remember,&rdquo; she said, as the coach drove away, &ldquo;remember
      twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella was even more splendid than on the first night, and the king&rsquo;s
      son never left her side He said so many pretty things that Cinderella
      could think of nothing else. She forgot the fairy&rsquo;s warning; she
      forgot her promise. Eleven o&rsquo;clock came, but she did not notice the
      striking. The half-hour struck, but the prince grew more charming, and
      Cinderella could hear nothing but his voice. The last quarter&mdash;but
      still Cinderella sat by the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the great clock on the tower struck the first stroke of twelve. Up
      sprang Cinderella, and fled from the room. The prince started to follow
      her, but she was too swift for him; in her flight, one of her glass
      slippers fell from her feet, and he stopped to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last stroke of twelve died away, as Cinderella darted down the steps
      of the palace. In a twinkling the gay lady was gone; only a shabby
      cinder-maid was running down the steps. The splendid coach and six, driver
      and footman,&mdash;all were gone; only a pumpkin lay on the ground, and a
      rat, six mice, and six lizards scampered off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella reached home, quite out of breath. She had saved nothing of all
      her finery but one little glass slipper. The prince had its mate, but he
      had lost the princess. He asked the soldiers at the palace gate if they
      had not seen her drive away. No; at that hour only a ragged girl had
      passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the two sisters came home from the ball, and Cinderella asked them if
      they had again seen the beautiful lady. Yes; she had been at the ball, but
      she had left suddenly, and no one knew what had become of her. But the
      prince would surely find her, for he had one of her glass slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke truly. A few days afterward, the king&rsquo;s son sent a
      messenger with a trumpet and the slipper through all the city. The
      messenger sounded his trumpet and shouted that the prince would marry the
      lady who could wear the glass slipper. So the slipper was first tried on
      by all the princesses; then by all the duchesses; next by all the persons
      belonging to the court; but in vain: not one could wear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was carried to all the fine houses, and it came at last to the two
      sisters. They tried with all their might to force a foot into the fairy
      slipper, but they could not. Cinderella stood by, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I were to try.&rdquo; Her two sisters jeered at her, but
      the messenger looked at Cinderella. He saw that she was very fair, and,
      besides, he had orders to try the slipper on the foot of every maiden in
      the kingdom, if need were.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he bade Cinderella sit down on a three-legged stool in the kitchen. She
      put out her little foot, and the slipper fitted like wax. The sisters
      stood in amaze. Then Cinderella put her hand into her pocket and drew
      forth the other glass slipper, and put it on her other foot.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0085.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The moment that Cinderella did this, the fairy, who stood by unseen,
      touched her with her wand, and the cinder-maid again became the beautiful,
      gayly dressed lady. The sisters saw that she was the same one whom they
      had seen at the ball. They thought how ill they had treated her all these
      years, and they fell at her feet and asked her to forgive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinderella was as good now as she had been when she was a cinder-maid. She
      freely forgave her sisters, and took them to the palace with her, for she
      was now to be the prince&rsquo;s wife. And when the old king and queen
      died, the prince and Cinderella became King and Queen.

      an Arab sat in his tent, a Camel thrust the flap of the tent aside, and
      looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray thee, master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me put my head
      within the tent, for it is cold without.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, and welcome,&rdquo; said the Arab; and the Camel
      stretched his head into the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might but warm my neck, also,&rdquo; he said, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your neck inside,&rdquo; said the Arab. Soon the Camel, who had
      been turning his head from side to side, said again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take but little more room if I put my fore legs within the
      tent. It is difficult standing without.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may also put your fore legs within,&rdquo; said the Arab,
      moving a little to make room, for the tent was very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not stand wholly within?&rdquo; asked the Camel, finally.
      &ldquo;I keep the tent open by standing as I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Arab. &ldquo;I will have pity on you as
      well as on myself. Come wholly inside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Camel came forward and crowded into the tent. But the tent was too
      small for both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Camel, &ldquo;that there is not room for
      both of us here. It will be best for you to stand outside, as you are the
      smaller; there will then be room enough for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that he pushed the Arab a little, who made haste to get outside
      of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a wise rule to resist the beginnings of evil.

      TOM THUMB

    <h3>
      I. TOM IS SOLD FOR A BARGAIN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> poor woodman once
      sat by the fire in his cottage, and his wife sat by his side, spinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lonely it is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for you and me to sit here
      by ourselves without any children to play about and amuse us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is very true,&rdquo; said his wife, as she turned her
      wheel. &ldquo;How happy should I be, if I had but one child. If it were
      ever so small, if it were no bigger than my thumb, I should be very happy
      and love it dearly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it came to pass that the good woman had her wish, for some time
      afterward she had a little boy who was healthy and strong, but not much
      bigger than her thumb. So they said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little
      as he is, we will love him dearly!&rdquo; and they called him Tom Thumb.
      They gave him plenty to eat, yet he never grew bigger. Still his eyes were
      sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a bright little
      fellow, who always knew what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, and
      he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had some one to bring the cart after me, for I want to
      make haste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O father,&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;I will take care of that. The
      cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.&rdquo; The woodman
      laughed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be? You cannot reach up to the horse&rsquo;s bridle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, father. If my mother will only harness the horse,
      I will get into his ear, and tell him which way to go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;we will try for once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put
      Tom into his ear. There the little man sat and told the beast how to go,
      crying out, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; as he wanted. So
      the horse went on just as if the woodman were driving it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the horse fell to trotting too fast, and Tom called out,
      &ldquo;Gently, gently.&rdquo; Just then two strangers came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd it is,&rdquo; one of them said. &ldquo;There is a cart
      going along, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but I see no one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is strange,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Let us follow the
      cart and see where it goes.&rdquo; They went on into the wood, and came at
      last to the place where the woodman was. The cart drove up and Tom said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, father, here I am with the cart, safe and sound. Now, take me
      down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and lifted his son
      down with the other. He put him on a little stick, where he was as merry
      as you please. The two strangers looked on and saw it all, and did not
      know what to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little chap will make our fortune if we can get him, and carry
      him about from town to town as a show. We must buy him.&rdquo; Then they
      went to the woodman and asked him what he would take for the little man.
      &ldquo;He will be better off with us than with you,&rdquo; they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not sell him at all,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;My
      own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom heard what was said, and crept up his father&rsquo;s coat to his
      shoulder, and spoke in his ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the money, father, and let them have me. I&rsquo;ll soon come
      back to you.&rdquo; So the woodman at last agreed to sell Tom Thumb to the
      strangers for a large piece of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you like to sit?&rdquo; one of them asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice place for
      me. I can walk about there and see the country as we go along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They did as he wished. Tom took leave of his father, and went off with the
      two strangers. They kept on their way till it began to grow dark. Then Tom
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get down, I am tired.&rdquo; So the man took off his hat,
      and set him down on a lump of earth in a ploughed field, by the side of
      the road. But Tom ran about among the furrows, and at last slipped into an
      old mouse-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, masters. I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look sharp after me next time.&rdquo; They ran to the place and
      poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain. Tom
      crawled farther in. They could not get him, and as it was now quite dark
      they went away very cross.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. HOW TOM FRIGHTENED THE THIEVES
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Tom found they
      were gone, he crept out of his hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dangerous it is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to walk about in this
      ploughed field. If I were to fall from one of those big lumps I should
      surely break my neck.&rdquo; At last, he found a large, empty snail-shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0023" id="linkimage-0023"> </a>

      <a href="images/0093.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is lucky,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can sleep here very well,&rdquo;
      and in he crept. Just as he was falling asleep he heard two men pass by,
      and one said to the other:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall we manage to steal that rich farmer&rsquo;s silver and
      gold?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What noise was that? I am sure I heard some one speak,&rdquo; said
      the thief. He was in a great fright. They both stood listening, and Tom
      spoke up:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me with you, and I will show you how to get the farmer&rsquo;s
      money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look about on the ground, and listen where the sound comes from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little chap! What can you do for us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can get between the iron window bars, and throw you out
      whatever you want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good thought. Come along; we will see what you can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to the farmer&rsquo;s house, Tom slipped through the bars
      into the room, and then called out as loud as he could:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have all that is here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Softly, softly!&rdquo; said the thieves. &ldquo;Speak low, or you
      will wake somebody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom made as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the cook lay in the next room, and hearing a noise, she raised herself
      in her bed and listened. But the thieves had been thrown into a fright and
      had run away. By and by they plucked up courage, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little fellow is only trying to make fools of us.&rdquo; So
      they came back and spoke low to him, saying: &ldquo;Now let us have no
      more of your jokes, but throw out some of the money.&rdquo; Then Tom
      called out again as loud as he could:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Hold your hands; here it comes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook heard this plainly; she sprang out of bed, and ran to open the
      door. The thieves were off as if a wolf were after them, and the cook
      could see nothing in the dark. So she went back for a light, and while she
      was gone, Tom slipped off into the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook looked about and searched every hole and corner, but found
      nobody; she went back to bed, and thought she must have been dreaming with
      her eyes open. Tom crawled about in the hayloft, and at last found a good
      place to rest in. He meant to sleep till daylight, and then find his way
      home to his father and mother.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. INSIDE A COW
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>oor Tom Thumb! his
      troubles were only begun. The cook got up early to feed the cows. She went
      straight to the hayloft, and carried away a large bundle of hay, with the
      little man in the middle of it fast asleep. He slept on, and did not wake
      till he found himself in the mouth of a cow. She had taken him up with a
      mouthful of hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how did I manage to tumble into the
      mill?&rdquo; But he soon found out where he was, and he had to keep all
      his wits about him, or he would have fallen between the cow&rsquo;s teeth,
      and then he would have been crushed to death. At last he went down into
      her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather dark here,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they forgot to build
      windows in this room to let the sun in.&rdquo; He made the best of his bad
      luck, but he did not like his resting-place at all. The worst of it was,
      that more and more hay was coming down, and there was less and less room
      to turn round in. At last he cried out as loud as he could:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring me any more hay! don&rsquo;t bring me any more
      hay!&rdquo; The cook just then was milking the cow. She heard some one
      speak, but she saw nobody. Yet she was sure it was the same voice she had
      heard in the night. It put her into such a fright that she fell off her
      stool and upset her milk-pail. She ran off as fast as she could to the
      farmer, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir, the cow is talking.&rdquo; But the farmer said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman, thou art surely mad.&rdquo; Still, he went with her into the
      cow-house, to see what was the matter. Just as they went in, Tom cried out
      again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring me any more hay! don&rsquo;t bring me any more
      hay!&rdquo; Then the farmer was in a fright. He was sure the cow must be
      mad, so he gave orders to have her killed at once. The cow was killed, and
      the stomach with Tom in it was thrown into the barnyard.
    </p>

      IV. SAFE AT HOME AGAIN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>om soon set
      himself to work to get out, and that was not a very easy task. A hungry
      wolf was prowling about. Just as Tom had made room to get his head out the
      wolf seized the stomach and swallowed it. Off he ran, but Tom was not cast
      down. He began to chat with the wolf, and called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the house near the wood. You can crawl through the drain into
      the kitchen, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, and everything that
      is nice.&rdquo; This was the house where Tom Thumb lived. The wolf did not
      need to be asked twice. That very night he went to the house and crawled
      through the drain into the kitchen. There he ate and drank to his heart&rsquo;s
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he had eaten so much that he was ready to go away. But now
      he could not squeeze through the drain. This was just what Tom had thought
      of, and the little chap set up a great shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be quiet?&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;You will wake
      everybody in the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to me?&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;You have had
      your frolic; now I have a mind to be merry myself.&rdquo; And he began
      again to sing and shout as loud as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woodman and his wife were awakened by the noise, and peeped through a
      crack into the kitchen. When they saw a wolf there, they were in a great
      fright. The woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay behind,&rdquo; said the woodman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have knocked the wolf on the head, you run at him with the
      scythe.&rdquo; Tom heard all this, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father! I am here. The wolf has swallowed me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the woodman. &ldquo;We have found
      our dear child again. Do not use the scythe, wife, for you may hurt him.&rdquo;
      Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed
      him at once. They opened him, and set Tom Thumb free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;what fears we have had for you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have traveled all over
      the world since we parted, and now I am very glad to get fresh air again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in a mouse-hole, in a snail-shell, down a cow&rsquo;s
      throat, and inside the wolf, and yet here I am again, safe and sound.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;We will not sell you
      again for all the riches in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to
      eat and drink. And they bought him new clothes, for his old ones had been
      quite spoiled on his journey.

      The Tortoise lost no time. She started at once, and jogged straight on.

      The Hare knew he could come to the end in two or three jumps. So he lay

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you live a mere

      another person to get something that was in the room. When they caught

      THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOOD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. THE BEAUTY GOES TO SLEEP
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>nce upon a time
      there lived a king and queen who grieved that they had no child. But at
      last a daughter was born, and the king was very happy. He gave a great
      feast, and asked to it all the fairies in the land, seven in all. He hoped
      that each would give the child a gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of each fairy at the table was set a heavy gold plate, and by
      each plate a gold knife and fork. Just as they sat down to the feast, in
      came an old fairy who had not been invited. No one knew she was living.
      Fifty years before she had shut herself up in a tower, and had not been
      seen since.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king hurried off to find a gold plate and knife and fork for her also.
      But nothing could be found so fine as the seven plates which had been made
      for the seven fairies. The old fairy thought herself ill-used and grumbled
      in a low voice. At that, one of the young fairies feared she meant
      mischief to the child, and so, when the feast was over, hid herself behind
      the hangings in the hall. We shall soon see why she did this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fairies now began to give gifts to the child, beginning with the
      youngest. She gave her beauty; the next gave her wit; the third gave her
      grace; the fourth said she should dance perfectly; the fifth gave her a
      voice to sing; the sixth said she should play beautifully on the harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turn of the old fairy had now come. She shook her head wickedly and
      said the child would grow up, but when she was grown, she would pierce her
      hand, when spinning, and die of the wound. At this, all the company began
      to weep. But the fairy who had hidden came forward and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good cheer, king and queen. Your daughter shall not so die. I
      cannot entirely undo what my elder has done. The princess must pierce her
      hand when spinning, but instead of dying she shall fall into a deep sleep.
      The sleep shall last a hundred years. At the end of that time a king&rsquo;s
      son will come to wake her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was very sad, but he hoped he might prevent the evil. So he made
      a law that no one in the kingdom should spin or have a spinning wheel in
      the house, under pain of instant death.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well for fifteen years. Then it chanced that the princess was
      with the king and queen in one of their castles, and was spying about for
      herself. She came to a little chamber at the top of a tower, and there sat
      an honest old woman spinning. She was very old and deaf, and had never
      heard of the king&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m spinning, my pretty child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How charming it is!&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;How do you do
      it? Let me try if I can spin.&rdquo; She seized the spindle, but she was
      hasty and careless, and pierced her hand with its point. She fainted, and
      the old woman, in great alarm, ran for help. People came running from all
      sides, but they could not rouse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king heard the noise and came also. Then he saw that the cruel fairy
      had had her wish. His daughter would not wake for a hundred years. He laid
      her on the bed in the best room, and stood sadly looking upon her. She was
      asleep. He could hear her breathe. Her cheeks were full of color, but her
      eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the good fairy, who had said the princess should wake in a hundred
      years, was thousands of miles away at the time. But she knew of it, and
      came at once in a chariot of fire drawn by dragons. The king came to meet
      her, his eyes red with weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good fairy was very wise and saw that the princess would not know what
      to do if she awoke all alone in the castle, in a hundred years. So this is
      what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched with her wand every one in the castle except the king and the
      queen. She touched the maids of honor, the gentlemen, the officers, the
      stewards, cooks, boys, guards, porters, pages, footmen. She touched the
      horses in the stable, the grooms, the great mastiff in the court-yard, and
      the tiny lapdog of the princess that was on the bed beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment she touched them, they all fell asleep just as they were, not
      to wake again until the time came for their mistress to do so. Then they
      all would be ready to wait on her. Even the fire went to sleep, and the
      roasting-spit before the fire with its fowls ready for roasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the work of a moment. The king and queen kissed their daughter
      good-by and left the castle. The king sent forth a command that no one was
      to go near the castle. That was needless. In a quarter of an hour, a wood
      had grown about it so thick and thorny that nothing could get through it.
      The castle-top itself could only be seen from afar.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. THE BEAUTY WAKES
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter a few years
      the king and the queen died. They had no other child, and the kingdom
      passed into the hands of a distant family. A hundred years went by. The
      son of the king who was then reigning was out hunting one day, when he
      noticed the tower of a castle in the distance. He asked what castle it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      All manner of answers were given to him. One said It was a fairy castle;
      another said that a great monster lived there. At last an old man said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, more than fifty years ago I heard my father say that there
      was in that castle the most beautiful princess ever seen. She was to sleep
      for a hundred years, and was to be waked at last by the king&rsquo;s son,
      who was to marry her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prince at these words felt himself on fire. He had not a doubt
      that he was the one to awaken the princess. He set out at once for the
      wood, and when he drew near, the trees and thorns opened to offer him a
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on a long, straight road, and at the end was the castle in full
      view. He turned to look for his comrades. Not one was to be seen. The wood
      had closed again behind him. He was alone, and all was still about him.
      Forward he went and came to the castle-gate. He entered the court-yard,
      and stood still in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every side were the bodies of men and animals. But the faces of the men
      were rosy; it was plain that they were asleep. His steps sounded on the
      marble floor. He entered the guard-room. There the guards stood drawn up
      in line, with their spears in their hands, but they did not move. They
      were fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through one room after another; people were asleep in chairs, on
      benches, standing, sitting, lying down. He entered a beautiful room,
      covered with gold, and saw the most wonderful sight of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay a maiden so fair that she seemed to belong to another world. He
      drew near and knelt beside her. She did not stir. Her hand lay on her
      breast, and he touched his lips to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did this, her eyes opened and looked at the young man. She smiled,
      and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come, my prince? I have waited long for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince hardly knew how to answer. But he soon found his voice, and
      they talked for hours, and then had not said half that was in their heads
      to say.

      <a href="images/0111.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The moment that the princess waked, her little lapdog waked also. The
      great mastiff in the court-yard awoke; the horses in the stable and the
      grooms awoke; the footmen, the pages, the porters, the guards, the boys,
      the cooks, the stewards, the officers, the gentlemen, and the maids of
      honor, all awoke. The fire began to burn again, the spits turned round,
      and the fowls began to roast.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, while the prince and the princess forgot the hours in talk, these
      people began to be hungry. The maids of honor went to the princess to tell
      her that they all waited for her. Then the prince took the princess by the
      hand and led her into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed in great splendor. But the prince did not hint that she
      looked as the picture of his great-grandmother looked. He thought her all
      the more charming for that, but he did not tell her so. The musicians
      played excellent but old music at supper. After supper the prince and
      princess were married in the chapel of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day they left the castle. All the people followed them down the
      long path. The wood opened again to let them through. Outside they met the
      prince&rsquo;s men, and glad they were to see the prince once more. He
      turned to show them the castle, but there was no castle to be seen, and no
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince and princess rode gayly away, and when the old king and queen
      died, they reigned in their stead.

    <h2>
      DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. DICK GOES TO LONDON
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the olden times
      there lived in the country, In England, a boy by the name of Dick
      Whittington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know who his parents were, for he had been born and brought up
      in the poor-house. There he was cruelly treated. When he was seven years
      of age, he ran away and lived by what he could get from kind people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard that the streets of London were paved with gold. Being now a
      sturdy youth, he set out for the city to make his fortune. He did not know
      the way, but he fell in with a carter, who was bound for London, and he
      followed the cart. When night came, he helped the carter by rubbing down
      the horses, and for this he was paid with a supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trudged on day after day, until they came to the famous city. The
      carter was afraid Dick would hang about him and give him trouble. So he
      gave him a penny and told him to begone and find some work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick went from street to street, but he knew no one. He was ragged and
      forlorn, and looked like a beggar. Nobody gave him anything to do. Once in
      a while some one gave him something to eat, but at last he had nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days he went about hungry and almost starved, but he would rather
      starve than steal. At the end of the second day he came to a merchant&rsquo;s
      house in Leadenhall Street, and stood before it, weary and faint. The
      ill-natured cook saw him and came out and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away from here, or I will kick you away!&rdquo; He crept off a
      little distance and lay down on the ground, for he was too weak to stand.
      As he lay there, the merchant who lived in the house came home, and
      stopped to speak to him. He spoke sharply, and told him to get up, that it
      was a shame for him to be lying there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dick got up, and after falling once, through faintness and want of
      food, made out to say that he was a poor country boy, nearly starved. He
      would do any work if he might have food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fitzwarren, the merchant, took pity on him. He brought him into the
      house, and bade the servants look after him. He gave him a place under the
      cook, and this was the beginning of Dick&rsquo;s fortune. But Dick had a
      hard time of it. The servants made sport of him. The ill-natured cook
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are to do? You are to come under me. So look
      sharp. Clean the spits and the pans, make the fires, wind up the
      roasting-jack, and do nimbly all the dirty work I set you about, or else I
      will break your head with my ladle, and kick you about like a foot-ball.&rdquo;
      This was cold comfort, but it was better than starving. &ldquo;What gave
      him more hope was the kind notice he had from his master&rsquo;s daughter,
      Mistress Alice. She heard Dick&rsquo;s story from her father, and called
      for the boy. She asked him questions, and he was so honest in his answers,
      that she went to her father, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor boy whom you brought into the house is a good, honest
      fellow. I am sure he will be very useful. He can clean shoes, and run
      errands, and do many things which our servants do not like to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. DICK&rsquo;S CAT
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>o Dick was kept,
      and a cot bed was given him in the garret. He was up early and worked
      late. He left nothing undone that was given him to do. For all that, he
      could not please the cook, who was very sour to him. Still, he bore her
      blows rather than leave so good a home. Then the cook told tales about
      him, and tried to get him sent away, but Mistress Alice heard of it. She
      knew how ill-tempered the cook was, and so she made her father keep Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not the whole of Dick Whittington&rsquo;s trouble. The garret
      where he lay at night had long been empty, and a great number of mice had
      made their home in it. They ran over Dick&rsquo;s face, and kept up such a
      racket that he knew not which was worse, the cook by day or the mice by
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only hope that the cook might marry or get tired of the place,
      and that he might in some way get a cat. It chanced, soon after, that a
      merchant came to dinner, and as it rained hard, he stayed all night. In
      the morning Dick cleaned the merchant&rsquo;s shoes and brought them to
      his door. For this service the merchant gave him a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went through the street on an errand that morning, he saw a woman
      with a cat under her arm. He asked her the price of the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good mouser,&rdquo; said the woman: &ldquo;you may have it
      for a sixpence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have only a penny,&rdquo; said Dick. The woman found that she
      really could get nothing more, so she sold the cat to Dick for a penny. He
      brought it home, and kept it out of the way all day for fear the cook
      would see it. At night he took the cat up to the garret, and made her work
      for her living. Puss soon rid him of one plague.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Fitzwarren sent out a ship to trade with far countries, he used
      to call his servants together, and give each a chance to make some money,
      by sending out goods in the ship. He thought that thus his ship had better
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was again making a venture, and each of the servants brought
      something to send; all but Whittington. Mistress Alice saw that he did not
      come, and she sent for him, meaning to give him some simple goods, that he
      too might have a share in the venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after many excuses, he was obliged to appear, he fell on his knees,
      and prayed them not to jeer at a poor boy. He had nothing he could claim
      for his own but a cat, which he had bought with a penny given him for
      cleaning shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Mistress Alice offered to lay something down for him. But her
      father told her the custom was for each to send something of his own. So
      he bade Dick bring his cat, which he did with many tears, and gave her
      over to the master of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook, and indeed all the servants, after this plagued Dick, and jeered
      at him so much for sending his cat, that he could bear it no longer. He
      said to himself that he would leave the house and try his fortune
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. BOW BELLS
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e packed his
      bundle one night, and the next day, early, set forth to seek his fortune.
      He left the house behind him, but his heart began to sink. However, he
      would not turn back, but kept on. At last he sat down in the field to
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Bow Bells, that is, the bells of a church in Bow Street,
      began to ring merrily. Dick heard them, and as they rang, he fancied he
      heard them sing,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Turn again, Whittington,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lord Mayor of London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a fine song to hear, and Dick began to pluck up heart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0029" id="linkimage-0029"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/0121m.jpg" alt="0121m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0121.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Still the bells rang. It was very early; no one was yet astir at the
      merchant&rsquo;s house, and Dick, with new courage, took up his bundle,
      obeyed the bells, and walked quickly back to the house. He had left the
      door open, so he crept in and took up his daily task. About this time, the
      ship which carried Dick&rsquo;s cat was driven by the winds, and came to a
      place on the Barbary coast, where the English seldom went. The people
      received the master of the ship well, and he traded with them. As his
      wares were new, they were very welcome. At last the king of that country,
      being greatly pleased, sent for the captain to come and dine at the
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was not set on a table, but the cloth was laid on the floor, as
      this was the custom of the country. The guests sat cross-legged before the
      feast. But when the dishes were set down, the smell of the dinner brought
      a great company of rats, and these rats helped themselves without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the ship was amazed, and asked the nobles if it was not very
      unpleasant to have this swarm of rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;very much so. The king would give half
      his wealth to be rid of them. They not only come to the table, but they
      make free with his chamber and even his bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain, thinking at once of Dick&rsquo;s
      cat, &ldquo;I have an English beast on board my ship which will quickly
      clear the palace of all the rats.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; said the king, when he heard of this. &ldquo;For
      such a thing I will load your ship with gold, diamonds, and pearls.&rdquo;
      At that the shrewd captain made much of the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most famous thing in the world,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      cannot spare her, for she keeps my ship clear of rats, or else they would
      spoil all my goods.&rdquo; But the king would not take no for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No price shall part us,&rdquo; he said. So the cat was sent for,
      and the table was again spread. The rats came as before, but the captain
      let the cat loose, and she made short work of them. Then she came purring
      and curling up her tail before the king, as if she would have her reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was so pleased with the cat, that he gave ten times more for her
      than for all the goods in the ship. Then the ship sailed away with a fair
      wind, and arrived safe at London. She was the richest ship that ever
      entered port.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV. LORD MAYOR WHITTINGTON
    </h3>
    <p>
      The master took the box of pearls and jewels with him on shore, and went
      straight to the merchant&rsquo;s house. He gave his account to Mr.
      Fitz-warren, who was greatly pleased at the fortunate voyage, and called
      his servants together, to receive their profit. Then the master showed the
      box of pearls and jewels, and told the story of Whittington&rsquo;s cat,
      and how Puss had earned this wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Mr. Whittington,&rdquo; said Mr. Fitzwarren. &ldquo;I will not
      take one farthing from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dick was in the kitchen cleaning pots and pans. When he was told that
      the merchant had sent for &ldquo;Mr. Whittington,&rdquo; he thought every
      one was making fun of him, and he would not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, he went as far as the door. The merchant bade him come in, and
      placed a chair for him. At that poor Dick was sure they were making fun of
      him, and the tears came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only a simple fellow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not mean
      harm to any one. Do not mock me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Whittington, we are serious with you,&rdquo; said the
      merchant. &ldquo;You are a much richer man than I am,&rdquo; and he gave
      him the box of pearls and jewels worth quite three hundred thousand
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Dick could not believe his good fortune. When at last he was
      persuaded, he fell upon his knees and thanked God who had been so good to
      him. Then he turned to his master and wished to give him of his wealth,
      but Mr. Fitzwarren said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Whittington. I will not take a penny from you. It is all
      yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Dick turned to Mistress Alice, who also refused. He bowed low, and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, whenever you please to make choice of a husband, I will make
      you the greatest fortune in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave freely to his fellow servants. Even to his enemy, the cook,
      he gave a hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Whittington was now a rich man. He laid aside his poor clothes,
      and was dressed well and handsomely. He had grown strong and tall in
      service, and was indeed a fine man to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well behaved and of a good mind and heart. Mr. Fitzwarren made him
      known to the other merchants, and let him see how business was carried on.
      Then, seeing that he was as honest and good as he was rich, he told
      Whittington that he might have his daughter in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Dick felt himself unworthy of Mistress Alice. But he saw that
      she looked kindly on him, and he remembered how good she had been to him
      from the beginning. So he made bold to ask Mistress Alice to be his wife,
      and they had a grand wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the wedding was over, Mr. Fitzwarren asked him what he meant to do,
      and Mr. Whittington said he would like to be a merchant. So the two became
      partners, and grew to be very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rich as he was, this merchant never forgot that he was once poor Dick
      Whittington. The promise of Bow Bells came true, and three times he was
      chosen Lord Mayor of London. He fed the hungry, and cared for the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was Lord Mayor of London the third time, it was his duty to
      receive King Henry V and his queen at Guildhall, which was the Mayor&rsquo;s
      palace. It was just after a famous war with France, which England had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, at the feast, made the lord mayor a knight, so that now he was
      Sir Richard Whittington. There was a very pleasant fire on the hearth at
      the time. It was made of choice wood. Mace and other spices were mixed
      with the wood. The king praised the fire, and Sir Richard said,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will make it still more pleasant.&rdquo; At that he threw upon the flames
      one piece of paper after another. They were the written promises of the
      king, to pay back money lent to him by London merchants, when he was
      carrying on the war. Sir Richard had bought them for sixty thousand
      pounds. That was the way he paid the king&rsquo;s debt, for now there was
      nothing to show that the king owed anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the story of Dick Whittington and his cat. How much is true, and
      how much was made up, I do not know, for what happened took place five
      hundred years ago.

      THE CAT, THE MONKEY, AND THE CHESTNUTS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> Cat and a Monkey
      were sitting one day by the hearth, watching some chestnuts which their
      master had laid down to roast. The chestnuts had begun to burst with the
      heat, and the Monkey said to the Cat:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is plain that your paws were made to pull out those chestnuts.
      Your paws are, indeed, exactly like our master&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cat was greatly flattered by this speech, and reached forward for the
      tempting chestnuts. Scarcely had she touched the hot ashes than she drew
      back with a cry, for she had burned her paw. She tried again, and made out
      to get one chestnut. Then she pulled another, and a third, though each
      time she singed the hair on her paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she could pull no more, she turned, and found the Monkey had taken
      this time to crack the chestnuts and eat them.

      of young Larks in a field of corn, which was just ripe. The mother,
      looking every day for the reapers, left word, whenever she went out in
      search of food, that her young ones should tell her all the news they
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when she was absent, the master came to look at his field.
      &ldquo;It is time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to call in my neighbors and get
      my corn reaped.&rdquo; When the old Lark came home, the young ones told
      their mother what they had heard, and begged her to move them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If he trusts to his neighbors,
      he will have to wait awhile yet for his harvest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, the owner came again, and found the sun hotter, the corn riper,
      and nothing done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not an hour to be lost,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We cannot
      depend upon our neighbors. We must call in our relations.&rdquo; Turning
      to his son, he said, &ldquo;Go, call your uncles and cousins; and see that
      they begin to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Larks, in great fear, told their mother what the farmer had
      said. &ldquo;If that be all,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do not be frightened.
      The relations have harvest work of their own. But take notice of what you
      hear next time, and be sure to let me know.&rdquo;

      She went abroad the next day, and the owner coming, and finding the grain
      falling to the ground because it was over ripe, said to his eon, &ldquo;We
      must wait no longer for our neighbors and friends. Do you go to-night and
      hire some reapers, and we will set to work ourselves tomorrow.&rdquo;

      When the young Larks told their mother this,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is time for us to be off. When a

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wretches we are,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;to die just for a
      moment of pleasure!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it is that greediness is the cause of many evils.

    <h2>
      BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. BEAUTY AND HER SISTERS
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was once a
      rich merchant who had six children, three sons and three daughters. He
      loved them more than he loved all his riches, so that he was always
      seeking to make them happy and wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughters were very pretty; but the youngest was more than pretty&mdash;she
      was beautiful. As every one called her Little Beauty when she was a child,
      and she became more lovely every year, the name grew up with her, so that
      she had no other than just&mdash;Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Beauty was as good as she was beautiful. But her elder sisters were
      ill-natured and jealous of her, and could not bear to hear her called
      Beauty. They were very proud, too, of their father&rsquo;s riches, and put
      on great airs. They would not visit the daughters of other merchants, but
      were always following persons who had titles, Lady This and Duchess That.
      They laughed at Beauty, who lived quietly at home with their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was so rich that many great merchants wished to marry his
      daughters. But the two eldest always said that they could never think of
      marrying anybody below a duke, or at the least an earl. As for Beauty, she
      thanked her lovers for thinking so well of her, but as she was still very
      young, she wished to live a few years longer with her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that the merchant all at once lost his great wealth.
      Nothing was left but one small house in the country, and there the poor
      man told his children they must now go, and earn their daily bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two eldest daughters said they need not go, for they had plenty of
      lovers who would be glad enough to marry them, even though they had lost
      their fortune. But they were wrong, for their lovers would not look at
      them now, and jeered at them in their trouble, because they had been so
      proud before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet every one felt sorry for Beauty. Several gentlemen who loved her
      begged her still to let them marry her, though she had not a penny. Beauty
      refused, and said she could not leave her father now that trouble had come
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the family went to live in the small house in the country. There the
      merchant and his three sons ploughed and sowed the fields, and worked hard
      all day. Beauty rose at four o&rsquo;clock every morning, put the house in
      order, and got breakfast for the whole family. It was very hard at first,
      for no one helped her. But every day it grew easier to work, and Beauty
      grew stronger and rosier. When her work was done, she could read, or play
      on her harp, or sit at her spinning-wheel, singing as she spun.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for her two sisters, they were idle and unhappy, and became quite
      helpless. They never got up till ten o&rsquo;clock. They spent the day
      moping and fretting, because they no longer had fine clothes to wear, and
      could not go to fine parties. They jeered at Beauty, and said that she was
      nothing but a servant-girl after all, to like that kind of living. But
      Beauty did not mind them, and lived on cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been in the country a year, when one morning the merchant had a
      letter. It brought the news that a ship laden with rich goods belonging to
      him had not been lost after all, and had just come into port. The two
      sisters were half wild with joy, for now they could soon leave the
      farm-house, and go back to the gay city.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their father was about to go to the port to settle his business
      there, they begged him to bring back all manner of fine things for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the merchant asked Beauty:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall I bring you, Beauty?&rdquo; for Beauty had yet asked
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, since you ask me, dear father, I should like you to bring me a
      rose, for none grow in these parts.&rdquo; Now Beauty did not care so very
      much for a rose, but she did not like to seem to blame her sisters, or to
      appear better than they, by saying that she did not wish for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man set off; but all was not as he had hoped. The ship had come
      in, but there was a dispute about the cargo. He went to law, and it ended
      in his turning back poorer than when he left his home.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. THE BEAST AT HOME
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e set out to
      return to the farm-house. When he was within thirty miles of home, he came
      to a large wood through which he must pass. The snow began to fall, and
      covered the path. The night closed in, and it grew so dark and so cold
      that the poor man gave himself up for lost. He could not see the way, and
      he was faint with cold and hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, he saw a light at the end of a long avenue of trees. He
      turned into the avenue, and rode until he came to the end of it. There he
      found a great palace; the windows were all lighted, and the door stood
      open, but he saw no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the stable was also open, and his horse walked in. A crib full
      of hay and oats was there, and the tired beast fell to eating heartily.
      The merchant left his horse in the stall and entered the palace. He saw
      nobody and heard nobody, but a fire was burning on the hearth, and a table
      was spread with choice food, and set for one person. He was wet to the
      skin, and went to the fire to dry himself, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the master of the house or his servants will not blame me
      for this. No doubt some one will soon come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, but no one came. The clock struck eleven. Then, faint for want
      of food, he went to the table and ate some meat, yet all the time in a
      great fright. But when he was no longer hungry, he began to pluck up
      courage, and to look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck twelve. He left the hall, and passed through one room
      after another until he came to one where there was a bed. It was made
      ready, and, since he was very tired, he lay down and slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant did not wake until ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning. He had
      placed his clothes on a chair by the side of the bed. They had been nearly
      ruined by the storm, and were besides old and worn. Now he saw a wholly
      new suit in their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to think he must be in the palace of some fairy, and he was sure
      of it when he looked out of the window. The snow had gone, and a lovely
      garden lay before him, full of flowers. He dressed and went back to the
      hall. A table was spread for breakfast, and he at once sat down to it.
      Then he went to get his horse. On the way he passed some roses. He
      remembered Beauty, and plucked a rose to take home with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had done this, he heard a frightful roar, and saw a dreadful
      Beast coming toward him. He was so frightened that he nearly fell down.
      The Beast cried out in a loud voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful man! I saved your life by letting you come into my
      palace. I gave you food to eat and a bed to rest in, and now you steal my
      roses, which I love beyond everything. You shall pay for this with your
      life!&rdquo; The poor man threw himself on his knees before the Beast,
      saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my lord. I did not know I was doing wrong. I only
      wanted to pluck a rose for one of my daughters. She asked me to bring one
      home to her. I pray you, do not kill me, my lord.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a lord. I am a Beast. I hate soft words, and you will not
      catch me by any of your fine speeches. You say you have daughters. Well, I
      will forgive you, if one of them will come and die in your stead. But
      promise that, if they refuse, you will come back in three months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant did not mean in the least to let one of his daughters die for
      him. But he wished to see his children once more before he died, so he
      promised to return if one of his daughters would not die for him. The
      Beast then told him to go back to the room where he had slept. There he
      would find a chest. He might fill it with anything he found in the palace,
      and it would be sent after him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. BEAUTY GOES TO THE BEAST
    </h3>
    <p>
      The merchant did as he was bid. The floor of the room was covered with
      gold, and he filled the chest. If he must die, he would at least provide
      for his children. Then he took his horse and rode out of the wood, and
      came at last to his home. He held the rose in his hand, and as the
      daughters came out to meet him, he gave it to the youngest, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, Beauty. You little know what it has cost your poor father;&rdquo;
      and then he told all that had happened since he left home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two eldest daughters began to cry aloud, and to blame Beauty. Why did
      she ask for roses? Why did she not ask for dresses, as they did; then all
      would have gone well. Now the hard-hearted thing, they said, did not shed
      a tear. Beauty replied quietly that it was of little use to weep. She
      meant to go and die in her father&rsquo;s stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the three brothers. &ldquo;We will go and seek
      this Beast, and either he or we must die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all in vain,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;You do not know
      the Beast. He is more mighty than you can think. No! you must stay and
      care for your sisters. At the end of three months I shall go back and die.&rdquo;
      The merchant then went to his room, and there he found the chest of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was greatly amazed. He had forgotten the promise of the Beast. But he
      said nothing about the chest to his daughters. He was sure they would
      tease him to go back to town to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauty said little, but when the three months were over, she made ready to
      go with her father. The brothers and sisters bade them good-by, and wept
      over Beauty. The brothers wept real tears, but the sisters rubbed their
      eyes with onions, so as to make tears; they did not really care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse took the right road, as if he knew the way, and when he came to
      the palace, he went at once to the stable. The merchant and Beauty entered
      the palace. They found the table spread for two persons, and they sat down
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper there was a great roar as before, and the Beast entered.
      Beauty trembled, and the Beast turned to her and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come of your own self?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Beauty, still trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I thank you. But you, sir,&rdquo; and he turned to the father,
      &ldquo;get you gone to-morrow, and never let me see your face again.
      Goodnight, Beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Beast,&rdquo; she replied, and Beast walked off. The
      merchant begged and begged his daughter to leave him, and to go back to
      her home. But she was firm, and when the morning came, she made him leave
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Beast will not hurt Beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauty wept, but she was a brave girl, and soon she dried her eyes, and
      began to walk through the palace. She came to a door, and over it was
      written Beauty&rsquo;s Room. She opened the door, and found herself in a
      fine chamber, with books, music and a harp, and many beautiful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be that I have only a day to live,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;for why should all this be done for me?&rdquo; She opened a book
      and saw written in letters of gold: <i>Your wishes and commands shall be
      obeyed. You are here the queen over everything</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I wish most of all I could see my
      father and know what he is doing.&rdquo; Just then her eyes fell on a
      large looking-glass, and in it she saw her father just reaching home. Her
      sisters came out to meet him. They tried to look sad, but it was plain
      that they were not sorry to see him come home alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight in the glass was only for a moment, then it faded, and Beauty
      turned away and in her mind thanked Beast for what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon she found dinner ready for her, and sweet music sounded as she
      ate. But she saw nobody. At night Beast came and asked leave to sup with
      her. Of course she could not say no, but she sat in a fright all through
      supper. He did not speak for some time. Then he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauty, do you think me very ugly?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Beast; I cannot tell a lie. But I think you are very good.&rdquo;
      Nothing more was said, and Beauty was beginning to be rid of her fear,
      when all at once he asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauty, will you marry me?&rdquo; Beauty was in a fright again, but
      she answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Beast.&rdquo; He gave a great sigh which shook the house. Then
      he got up from the table and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Beauty,&rdquo; and went away. Beauty was glad he had
      gone, but she could not help pitying him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV. THE CHARM IS BROKEN
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>eauty lived in
      this way three months. The Beast came to supper every night. He did not
      grow less ugly, but Beauty did not mind his ugliness so much, for she saw
      how kind he really was. But there was one trouble. Every night the Beast
      was sure to ask:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you marry me, Beauty?&rdquo; and Beauty always answered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Beast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But one night he begged her at least never to leave him. Now it chanced on
      that very day Beauty had looked in her glass. There she saw her father
      sick with grief, for he thought his child was dead. Her sisters were
      married. Her brothers were soldiers. So she told all this to the Beast,
      and wept and said she should die if she could not see her father once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not refuse to let me go!&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Beast. &ldquo;I will not refuse you. I would
      much rather your poor Beast should die of grief for your absence. So you
      may go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, dear Beast,&rdquo; said Beauty, &ldquo;and I will
      surely come back in a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you wish to come back, Beauty, lay your ring on the table
      before you go to bed, and you will find yourself here when you wake.
      Good-night, Beauty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Beast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Beauty woke to find herself at the farm-house. Her father
      was so glad to see her once more, and to know she was alive and well, that
      his sickness left him at once. He sent for her sisters, who came and
      brought their husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      These husbands were not much to be praised. One was so vain that he looked
      at himself, and seldom looked at his wife. The other had a sharp tongue,
      and liked to use it on other people, and most of all on his own wife. So
      the sisters were no happier than they had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were still jealous of Beauty, and they laid a plan for her hurt.
      They thought if they could keep her at home after the week was over, the
      Beast would be so angry, he would soon make an end of her. So, at the end
      of the week, they made a great ado, and begged her to stay just a little
      longer. Beauty could not help being glad to have her sisters want her. She
      said she would stay one week more; but she was not quite easy in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the tenth day the sisters gave her a feast, in order to
      make her forget the Beast. But at night Beauty dreamed she saw poor Beast
      lying half dead on the grass in the palace garden. She woke in tears, and
      at once laid her ring on the table, and then went to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke, she was once more in her room at the palace. All day she
      wished for supper time to come. Then she would see Beast again. But supper
      time came, and no Beast was at the table. Nine o&rsquo;clock struck, and
      still Beast did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0031" id="linkimage-0031"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0143.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Beauty flew into the garden. She went to the spot she had dreamed of, and
      there lay poor Beast on the grass. She felt his heart beat. He was still
      alive. She ran for some water and threw it on his face. The Beast opened
      his eyes and said in a faint voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forgot your promise. I could not live without you, and I meant
      to starve to death. Now you have come, and I shall die happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you shall not die, dear Beast,&rdquo; cried Beauty. &ldquo;You
      shall live to be my husband, for now I feel I really love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the whole palace was ablaze with light. Music sounded, and
      there was a stir all about. There was no Beast, but in his place a very
      handsome prince was at Beauty&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken the charm that held me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is my poor Beast?&rdquo; asked Beauty, weeping. &ldquo;I
      want my dear Beast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the Beast,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;A wicked fairy had
      power to make me live in that ugly form, till some good and beautiful maid
      should be found, so good as to love me in spite of my ugliness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauty was amazed, but she took the Prince&rsquo;s hand and they went into
      the palace. The people of the country were full of joy. They had mourned
      for their Prince, and now he had suddenly come back again, and with him
      was a beautiful princess. So Beauty and the Beast, who was no longer a
      Beast, reigned happily in the kingdom.

      drinking at a brook, and set about finding some good reason for catching
      him. So he went to a place a little higher up the brook, and called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you muddle the water that I am drinking?&rdquo;
    </p>

      &ldquo;You may make ever so good excuses,&rdquo; said the Wolf, finally;
      &ldquo;I shall eat you all the same.&rdquo;

      not stopped by the best of reasons.

    <h2>
      THE WHITE CAT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. THE PALACE OF THE WHITE CAT
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> King had three
      sons, handsome, brave, and generous. Some persons about the court,
      however, made him believe that these sons were eager to have him die,
      because each wanted to be king. This was not at all true, but the King
      believed it, and made a plan to get them out of the way. He sent for them
      and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sons, you must see that I am growing old, and cannot attend
      to state affairs as I once used to. It is right that I should make one of
      you king in my stead. But first I should like something to amuse me when I
      am no longer king. I think I should like best a little dog. Now, the one
      of you who brings me the most perfect little dog shall be king in my
      stead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The princes were much surprised at the fancy of their father to have a
      little dog, but they all agreed to do as he had asked. They bade him
      good-by, and promised to come back in a year. They went off together to an
      old palace three miles away. There they had something to eat, and then set
      off on separate roads. But they agreed to meet again at the palace at the
      end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we will see what happened to the youngest of the three brothers. He
      went from town to town looking for handsome dogs. He bought one, and then,
      when he found a handsomer dog, he bought that and gave the other away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he found himself in a wood. Night came on, and it began to rain.
      There were thunder and lightning, and he lost his way. He groped about and
      saw a light in the distance. He went toward it, and soon was in front of a
      fine palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door to the palace was of gold, studded with sapphires, and these
      shone with a bright light. This was the light the Prince had seen. The
      walls of the palace were of fine china, and there were wonderful paintings
      upon them. These paintings showed the adventures of all the fairies from
      the beginning of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince saw a deer&rsquo;s foot hanging by the side of the door. It was
      hung at the end of a chain of diamonds, and was plainly a bell-pull. He
      was greatly astonished, for he saw no one, and he wondered that thieves
      had not long ago stolen the diamonds and the sapphires.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the deer&rsquo;s foot and heard a bell ring. Soon the golden
      door opened. He saw nobody, but he saw twelve Hands in the air, each
      holding a torch. He looked and did not know what to do. Then he felt
      himself gently pushed from behind, so he walked on into the palace. There
      he heard a voice singing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Welcome, Prince, no danger fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Mirth and love attend you here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hands with the torches led him through one door after another, into
      one room after another. Each room was more splendid than the last. Finally
      the Hands drew a chair near a fire, and beckoned him to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hands he saw were white and fair. They took away his wet clothes, and
      brought him new fine linen, and a warm wrapper in which he sat before the
      fire. Then they placed before him a glass upon a stand, and began to comb
      and brush his hair gently. They brought a bowl with perfumed water in it,
      and washed his face and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Prince was fresh and warm, and the Hands gave him a princely suit
      of clothes. When he was dressed, they led him out of the chamber to a
      grand hall. Here a table was set with rich and dainty food. Two plates
      were on the table, and the Prince wondered who was to eat with him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. A YEAR OF SPORT
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ust then he looked
      up and saw a small figure coming toward him. It was covered with a long
      black veil, and was not more than a foot high. On each side walked a cat
      dressed in black, and behind came a great number of cats, some carrying
      cages full of rats, and others mouse-traps filled with mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince did not know what to think. The little figure drew near, and
      drew aside her veil. It was a cat, a beautiful White Cat, but looking sad
      and gentle. She said to the Prince:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are welcome, Prince. It makes me glad to have you come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I thank you for all your
      goodness to me. I cannot help thinking you must be a wonderful being, to
      have this beautiful palace, to be able to speak, and yet to be a cat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;but I do not like to
      talk, and I do not like to hear fine things said to me. Let us sit down to
      supper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hands then placed some dishes on the table, in front of the Prince and
      the White Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince had a pie made of young pigeons, but the White Cat had one made
      of fat mice. The Prince at first did not like to touch his food. He was
      not quite sure what it was, but the White Cat told him not to be afraid.
      The dishes before him had no bit of rat or mouse in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over, the Prince noticed that the White Cat carried a
      little picture hung by a cord upon one of her feet. He asked to look at
      it. It was a portrait of a young man. To his great surprise, it was his
      own likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask the White Cat to explain this, for she had a look which
      forbade him. They talked together about many things, and then the White
      Cat bade the Prince good-night. The Hands, with torches, led him to his
      chamber, and there he slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was waked in the morning by a noise outside. He got up, and the Hands
      brought him a handsome hunting-jacket. The noise kept on, and he looked
      out of the window. There he saw more than five hundred cats in the open
      space before the palace. They were making ready for a hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Cat soon came and asked him to join their sport, and he was
      given a wooden horse to ride on. The White Cat mounted a monkey. She wore
      a dragoon&rsquo;s cap, which made her look very bold and fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horns sounded, and away they went. The cats ran faster than the hares
      and rabbits, and when they caught any, they brought them to the Prince and
      the White Cat. They chased birds as well as rabbits. Up the trees they
      went, and the White Cat on the monkey climbed more quickly than any, and
      mounted the highest trees, to the eagle&rsquo;s nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the chase was over, they all went back to the palace. The White Cat
      sat down at the table with the Prince, and they had a fine supper. Again
      the Hands led the Prince to his chamber, and he slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it went on day after day. Every day there was some new pleasure, and
      the White Cat was so gentle, so sweet, and so thoughtful, that the Prince
      could not bear to think of leaving the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I go away from you?&rdquo; he cried one day. &ldquo;Can you
      not make me a cat to live here always? or, can you not make yourself a
      lady?&rdquo; But the White Cat only smiled, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a year had almost gone. The White Cat knew what day the Prince
      must return to his father, and told him that he had but three days left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;What shall I do? I have not
      yet found a dog small enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said the White Cat. &ldquo;I will see that you
      have a dog, and I will also give you a wooden horse, so that you can ride
      home in a few hours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day came, the White Cat gave the Prince an acorn, and told him to
      put it close to his ear. He did so, and could hear a little dog barking
      inside the acorn. He was delighted, and thanked the White Cat a thousand
      times.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. THE LITTLE DOG AND THE CAMBRIC
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Prince mounted
      his wooden horse, and soon was at the place where he was to meet his
      brothers. The two eldest told their stories. The youngest kept silence,
      and showed only a cheap cur. The brothers trod on each other&rsquo;s toes
      under the table, as much as to say, &ldquo;We have nothing to fear from
      this dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day they all went to the palace. The dogs of the two elder
      brothers were brought in on soft rugs; they were wrapped about in silk
      quilts, and it was hard to see anything of them. However, the King looked
      at each, and could not make up his mind which was the smaller and
      prettier. So the two princes began to quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the youngest son came forward. Nobody had looked at his cur, but
      now he showed them his acorn. He broke the shell, and out jumped a little
      dog. He held his finger ring, and the dog leaped through it. There was no
      doubt now who had the smallest and prettiest dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King could not possibly find any fault with the dog, but he could not
      bear to give up his crown yet. So he thanked his sons for their trouble,
      and asked them to try once more. He wished them to be gone a year, and at
      the end of that time to bring him a fine piece of cambric. It must be fine
      enough to be drawn through the eye of a small needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three princes thought this very hard, but they set off as before. The
      two eldest took different roads. The youngest mounted his wooden horse,
      and quickly came to the palace of the White Cat. There he was received
      with great joy. The Hands helped him to dismount, and the table was spread
      before him. The best food was given him, and the White Cat sat opposite.
      He told her what a hard task his father had set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be troubled,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have cats in my
      palace who can make just such cambric. So be at ease and enjoy yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince knew how to enjoy himself. He talked with the White Cat about
      all sorts of things, and they hunted together. And when he was alone, he
      could think about the White Cat, and what she said last. Oh, yes, he knew
      how to enjoy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus another year went by. At the end of the year the White Cat said to
      the Prince:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time you must go in state.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw in the yard a splendid carriage, covered with gold and
      diamonds. Twelve horses as white as snow were harnessed to it, and a troop
      of horsemen was ready to ride behind and by the side of the carriage. The
      White Cat bade the Prince good-by, and gave him a walnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this nut,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the cambric. But you must
      not open the nut till you come before the King.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the horses, and carried the Prince in a twinkling to the King&rsquo;s
      palace. His two brothers were already there. They all went into the King&rsquo;s
      presence, and the eldest brought out his piece of cambric. No one had ever
      seen anything so fine. The King took the needle. The tip end of the
      cambric went through the eye, but the piece could not be pulled further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second son tried, but his piece failed also. Then the youngest Prince
      came forward with an elegant box, covered with jewels. He opened the box
      and took out the walnut. He smiled, and looked about, and cracked the
      shell. Then he looked sober. There was no cambric there, only a filbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he cracked the shell of the filbert. Out came a cherry-stone. He
      looked more serious still. The brothers and the lords of the court began
      to laugh. What could be more silly than this Prince with his cherry-stone!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince now cracked the cherry-stone, and took out the kernel. He split
      it, and found a grain of wheat; he opened the grain of wheat, and there
      was a grain of millet-seed. All the court was now laughing. The Prince
      grew red in the face and muttered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O White Cat, White Cat, you have deceived me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said this, he felt a scratch on his arm. He saw nothing, but it
      was just as if a cat scratched him. That brought him to his senses. He
      opened the millet-seed very carefully, and drew forth a piece of cambric.
      It was four hundred yards long, and was so fine that it was easily drawn
      through the eye of the needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King could ask nothing more. But he was not ready to give up his
      crown, so he said to his sons:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done nobly. Now one of you must be king. But it will not
      do for one to be king without a queen. So go away and find the most
      beautiful woman in the world. At the end of the year come back. The one
      who brings the most beautiful woman shall marry her and have my kingdom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV. THE WHITE CAT HAS HER HEAD CUT OFF
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he three brothers
      set off again on their travels, and the youngest rode straight to the
      palace of the White Cat. He could not bear to speak or think of his
      errand. He was so happy, however, with the White Cat that he quite forgot
      everything for another year. At the end of that time, the &ldquo;White Cat
      herself reminded him what he had to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must now go back to your father, but you shall take with you a
      beautiful princess. Cut off my head and my tail, and throw them into the
      fire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;I cut off your head and tail! How
      can I, when I love you so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must. That is the way to prove your love. If you love me, do as
      I bid you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince looked at the White Cat. Her eyes said the same thing to him.
      He took his sword, and did as she bade him. No sooner had he done this
      than the White Cat was gone, and a beautiful princess stood before him. At
      the same moment the room was full of maids and gentlemen. All the cats
      were gone. The Prince was astonished. The beautiful princess sent away all
      the people, and then told the story of her life to the Prince.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V. THE WHITE CAT&rsquo;S STORY
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not think I have always been a cat. My father was a king, and
      had six kingdoms. He loved my mother dearly, and let her do just as she
      wished. She liked best to travel and to see new sights. One day she heard
      of a distant country where the fairies had a garden, and in this garden
      was the most delicious fruit ever eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wished at once to taste this fruit, and so she set off for the
      country. She came to a noble palace and knocked at the gate. No one came
      out. She waited. No one appeared anywhere in sight. But over the garden
      wall she saw the fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother bade her servants pitch her tent close by the gate. There
      she stayed six weeks. Yet she saw no one go in or out. She was so vexed
      and so disappointed that at the end of six weeks she fell sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night, when she was almost dead, she opened her eyes and saw an
      old woman, small and ugly. It was one of the fairies who owned the garden.
      This old woman was sitting in a chair by the bed, and spoke to my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you come here for our fruit?&rsquo; she asked.
      &lsquo;My sisters and I do not like it at all. We did not mean you should
      have any. But now you are very ill, and we do not want you to die here;
      you may have all you want, if you will give us what we ask and then go
      away.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said my mother,&rsquo; I will give you everything
      I have, to the half of my kingdom, if you will only give me the fruit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very well. You will have a child. When the child is born,
      give her to us. We will take care of her, and she shall be a beautiful
      princess.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is pretty hard,&rsquo; said my mother, &lsquo;but I
      must have the fruit, or I shall die. So the child shall be yours.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my mother rose and dressed, and went into the garden. Here she
      ate her fill. Besides, she ordered four thousand mules to be loaded with
      the fruit, for it was of a kind that would never spoil. Thus she traveled
      back to my father. He was overjoyed to see her, and she said nothing of
      the promise she had given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By and by, however, she grew sad, and my father asked her what
      troubled her. Then she told him the whole story. At first he was greatly
      troubled, but he began to think how he should prevent the fairies from
      getting his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I was born he had me taken to the top of a high tower.
      There were twenty flights of stairs leading up to the room in which I was
      placed. A door was at the foot of each flight, and was locked, and my
      father kept the key. He did not mean that any one should get at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the fairies heard of this, they were very angry. They sent
      forth a great dragon, and the dragon breathed forth fire, and burnt up the
      grass and trees. It was very fierce, too, and killed men, women, and
      children. So my father was filled with dismay, and sent word that the
      fairies should have me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI. THE WHITE CAT&rsquo;S STORY ENDED
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> was placed in a
      cradle of mother-of-pearl, and carried to the palace by the garden where
      my mother had eaten the fruit. The dragon at once disappeared, and all
      went well in my father&rsquo;s kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fairies gave me a room in a tower, and I had everything I could
      ask. Here I grew up. I knew nothing of my father or mother. The fairies
      came to see me, but they rode the dragon, and flew in at the window. You
      must know there was no door to the tower. There were windows, high up from
      the ground, and there was a garden upon the top of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fairies were very kind to me, and all went well. I played in
      the garden on the tower, and I had my birds and flowers. But one day I was
      sitting at one of the windows talking with my parrot, when I saw a
      fine-looking man below. He stood listening to the parrot and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had seen a man except in pictures, and I was very glad to
      see this one. We spoke to each other through the window, and so it went on
      day after day. At last I thought I could not bear to live alone in the
      tower, and I planned to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begged the fairies to bring me some cord and needles, to make a
      net with. There were birds flying about, and if I had a net I could catch
      one. They gave me these things, and I made a ladder which reached from my
      window to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to climb down the ladder, but before I could do so my lover
      had climbed up. He leaped in at my window. At first I was frightened, but
      then I was glad to have him with me. He gave me a picture of himself, but
      while we were talking the fairy Violent flew in at the window on the back
      of the dragon. She was in a great rage, and bade the dragon at once devour
      my lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to cast myself into the mouth of the dragon, for I no
      longer cared to live. But the fairy held me back, and said she had another
      punishment for me. She touched me with her wand, and I became at once a
      White Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She brought me to this palace, and gave me a troop of cats to wait
      on me. They were lords and ladies who had been turned into cats. The Hands
      were the hands of servants who could not be seen. Here I was to stay a cat
      until a prince should come who looked exactly like my lover, and who
      should cut off my head and my tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Prince, look at this picture. It is your exact image. You have
      saved me from the fairies, and I love you with all my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was overjoyed. He made haste to set out for his father&rsquo;s
      palace with the beautiful princess. Again the brothers stood before the
      King, each with a beautiful princess. The King was now at his wit&rsquo;s
      end, but the princess, who had lately been a White Cat, came forward and
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O King, it is a thousand pities that you should give up your
      kingdom. You are not old. You are very wise, and ought to reign many
      years. I have six kingdoms. Let me give one to each of your two eldest
      sons. Then the youngest son and I will still have four kingdoms. More than
      all, you will not have to decide which of us three princesses is the most
      beautiful.&rdquo; Everybody set up a shout. The three weddings took place
      at once, and the kingdoms were divided among the princes.

      and made himself at home. It was a good place to stay in, and there he
      meant to stay. By and by the Rabbit came home, and saw the Weasel at the
      window.

      &ldquo;Do you know that this is my house?&rdquo; the Rabbit asked.

      &ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; said the Weasel, &ldquo;what makes it yours? You

      THE TRAVELING MUSICIANS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I. HOW THEY SET OUT
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> Farmer had an Ass
      that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years. But the Ass
      was growing old, and every day was more and more unfit for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      His master was tired of keeping him, and began to think of putting an end
      to him. But the Ass saw there was mischief in the wind and took himself
      off slyly. He set out toward the great city. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; thought
      he, &ldquo;people will like to hear me bray, and I shall earn my living as
      a musician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had traveled a little way when he spied a Dog by the wayside. The Dog
      was lying down, and panting as if he were very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you pant so, my friend?&rdquo; asked the Ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Dog, &ldquo;my master was about to knock me
      on the head. I am old and weak, and can no longer hunt as I used. So I ran
      away. But how can I earn a living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye,&rdquo; said the Ass; &ldquo;I am going to the great city
      to be a musician; suppose you go with me, and try what you can do in the
      same way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Dog, and they jogged on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone far before they saw a Cat sitting in the middle of the
      road. The Cat wore a very sad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, my good lady,&rdquo; said the Ass, &ldquo;what is the matter
      with you? You look quite out of sorts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; said the Cat, &ldquo;well I may. How can I be in good
      spirits, when I fear for my life? I am beginning to grow old, and I like
      to lie at my ease by the fire, and not to run about the house after mice.
      So my mistress laid hold of me, and was about to drown me. I was lucky
      enough to get away from her. But what am I to live on?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Ass, &ldquo;come with us to the great city. You
      are a good night-singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; said the Cat, and she joined the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went, until they came to a farm-yard. There they saw a Cock
      perched upon the gate, and the Cock was crowing with all his might and
      main.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said the Ass; &ldquo;upon my word you make a famous
      noise; pray, what is all this about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the Cock, &ldquo;I was just now saying that it was
      going to be fine weather, when lo! the cook claps her hands to her ears,
      and says she means to cut my head off, and make broth of me for the guests
      that are coming to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; said the Ass. &ldquo;But come with us, Master
      Cock. It will be better than to stay here and have your head cut off.
      Besides, who knows? If we take care to sing in tune, we may get up some
      kind of concert; so, come along with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the Cock; and they all four went on
      their way.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II. HOW THEY GAVE A CONCERT
    </h3>
    <p>
      They could not reach the great city the first day. So, when night came on,
      they went into the wood to sleep. The Ass and the Dog lay down under a
      great tree; the Cat climbed up and sat on a branch; the Cock flew up to
      the top of the tree, for that was a very safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went to sleep, he looked out on all sides to see if the world
      were quiet. Afar off he saw something bright, and he called out to the
      others:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo; said the Ass, &ldquo;let us change our
      quarters, for our lodging here is not the best in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So say I,&rdquo; said the Dog. &ldquo;I should not be the worse for
      a bone or two, or a bit of meat.&rdquo; So off they all went to the spot
      where the Cock had seen the light. As they drew near, it became larger and
      brighter, till at last they came close to a house in which a gang of
      robbers lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ass was the tallest of the company, so he marched up to the window and
      peeped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ass,&rdquo; said the Cock, &ldquo;what do you see?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I see? Why, I see a table spread with all sorts of good
      things, and men sitting round it, making merry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a fine place for us to live in,&rdquo; said the Cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Ass, &ldquo;if we only could get in.&rdquo; So
      they all talked the matter over, and at last hit upon a plan. The Ass
      stood on his hind-legs, with his fore-feet resting on the window-sill; the
      Dog got upon his back; the Cat scrambled up to the Dog&rsquo;s shoulders;
      and the Cock flew up and sat upon the Cat&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><a name="linkimage-0036" id="linkimage-0036"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/0176m.jpg" alt="0176m " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0176.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When all was ready, they began their music. The Ass brayed, the Dog
      barked, the Cat mewed, and the Cock crowed; and then they all broke
      through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room. The glass
      fell with a smash upon the floor, and there was a great clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The robbers started when they heard the music. They were scared out of
      their wits when the Traveling Musicians came tumbling into the room. So
      they took to their heels at once.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III. HOW THEY MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME
    </h3>
    <p>
      As soon as they were gone, the Traveling Musicians sat down at the table.
      They ate all that the robbers had left, and as they were very hungry, they
      ate very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when they had cleared the table, they put out the lights, and each
      found a place in which to sleep. The Ass lay upon a heap of straw in the
      yard; the Dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door; the Cat rolled
      herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes; and the Cock perched upon
      a beam at the top of the house. They were all tired and soon fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time the robbers, who had not fled far, got over their fright.
      They saw that the lights were out, and that all was quiet. They began to
      think they had been frightened at nothing. One, bolder than the rest,
      crept back to the house. All was still; all was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way into the kitchen, and groped about to find a candle. He
      found the candle, and then went to the fire, as he thought, to light his
      candle. But the live coals which he thought he saw were the two fiery eyes
      of the Cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the candle close, to light it, but the Cat, not liking the joke,
      sprang at his face, and spit, and scratched him. Away he ran to the door.
      But there the Dog jumped up and bit him in the leg. As he was crossing the
      yard, the Ass kicked him, and the Cock, now awake, crowed with all his
      might.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the robber ran back to his comrades, as fast as his legs could
      carry him. He told them that a horrid witch had got into the house, and
      had spit at him, and scratched his face with long bony fingers. A man with
      a knife in his hand hid behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg. A
      black monster stood in the yard, and struck him with a club. And the judge
      sat upon the top of the house, and cried out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw the rascal up here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the robbers never dared to go back to the house. The Traveling
      Musicians were so pleased with their quarters, that they took up their
      abode there, and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.

      BELLING THE CAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was a sly Cat
      in a house, and the Mice were so plagued with her at every turn, that they
      called a council to plan a way by which they might guard against being
      caught by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be ruled by me,&rdquo; says one of the Mice, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      nothing like hanging a bell about the Cat&rsquo;s neck, to give warning
      when Puss is coming.&rdquo; They all thought that a capital plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;and now we are agreed upon the
      bell, say, who shall hang it upon the Cat&rsquo;s neck?&rdquo; But there
      was no one ready to bell the Cat.

      THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> Wolf once walked
      behind a flock of Sheep, and did them no harm. At first, the Shepherd
      treated him as an enemy, and kept watch against him. But when the Wolf
      made no sign of hurting the Sheep, the Shepherd began to think he was
      quite as good as a watch-dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day, when the Shepherd wished to go to the city, he left the Sheep
      in the care of this quiet Wolf. That was the chance the Wolf wanted, and
      he made sad havoc with the flock. When the Shepherd came back and saw the
      Sheep scattered, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It serves me right; for why did I trust Sheep to a Wolf?&rdquo;

      THE FROGS ASK FOR A KING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n old times, the
      Frogs lived in a free and easy way, each one as he pleased. But the elders
      among them did not like this, and begged Jove to send them a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jove thought them very foolish, and tossed a log into the middle of the
      pond. The Frogs were scared out of their wits, and plunged at once into
      the deepest hole. By and by, they peeped out and saw that King Log was
      stock-still.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to grow bolder; soon they laughed at King Log. Then they jumped
      up and sat on the log. That was not a king, they said, and off they went
      to Jove, and asked him to give them a new king.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Jove gave them an Eel. But the Eel was stupid, and the Frogs
      liked him no better. They sent a third time to Jove.

      At this Jove was angry, and sent them a king of another sort. He sent them
      King Stork, and King Stork caught the Frogs, one by one, and ate them,
      till there was not one left.
